<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hotel Helicon stood on a great rock
promontory that jutted far out into a sea of air
whose currents and eddies filled a wide, wild valley
in the midst of our southern mountain region.
It was a new hotel, built by a Cincinnati
man who founded his fortune in natural gas
speculations, and who had conceived the bright
thought of making the house famous at the
start by a stroke of rare liberality.</p>

<p>Viewing the large building from any favorable
point in the valley, it looked like a huge white bird
sitting with outstretched wings on the gray rock
far up against the tender blue sky. All around
it the forests were thick and green, the ravines
deep and gloomy and the rocks tumbled into
fantastic heaps. When you reached it, which
was after a whole day of hard zig-zag climbing,
you found it a rather plain three-story house,
whose broad verandas were worried with a mass
of jig-saw fancies and whose windows glared at
you between wide open green Venetian shutters.
Everything look new, almost raw, from the stumps
of fresh-cut trees on the lawn and the rope swings
and long benches, upon which the paint was
scarcely dry, to the resonant floor of the spacious
halls and the cedar-fragrant hand-rail of the
stairway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>There were springs among the rocks. Here
the water trickled out with a red gleam of iron
oxide, there it sparkled with an excess of carbonic
acid, and yonder it bubbled up all the
more limpid and clear on account of the offensive
sulphuretted hydrogen it was bringing forth.
Masses of fern, great cushions of cool moss and
tangles of blooming shrubs and vines fringed
the sides of the little ravines down which the
spring-streams sang their way to the silver
thread of a river in the valley.</p>

<p>It was altogether a dizzy perch, a strange, inconvenient,
out-of-the-way spot for a summer
hotel. You reached it all out of breath, confused
as to the points of the compass and disappointed,
in every sense of the word, with
what at first glance struck you as a colossal
pretense, empty, raw, vulgar, loud&mdash;a great
trap into which you had been inveigled by an
eloquent hand-bill! Hotel Helicon, as a name
for the place, was considered a happy one. It
had come to the proprietor, as if in a dream, one
day as he sat smoking. He slapped his thigh
with his hand and sprang to his feet. The word
that went so smoothly with hotel, as he fancied,
had no special meaning in his mind, for the gas
man had never been guilty of classical lore-study,
but it furnished a taking alliteration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hotel Helicon, Hotel Helicon,&rdquo; he repeated;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s just a dandy name. Hotel Helicon on
Mount Boab, open for the season! If that
doesn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em I&rsquo;ll back down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His plans matured themselves very rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in his mind. One brilliant idea followed another
in swift succession, until at last he fell upon the
scheme of making Hotel Helicon free for the
initial season to a select company of authors
chosen from among the most brilliant and
famous in our country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; he exclaimed, all to himself, &ldquo;but
won&rsquo;t that be a darling old advertisement! I&rsquo;ll
have a few sprightly newspaper people along
with &rsquo;em, too, to do the interviewing and puffing.
By jacks, it&rsquo;s just the wrinkle to a dot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Gaslucky was of the opinion that, like
Napoleon, he was in the hands of irresistible
destiny which would ensure the success of whatever
he might undertake; still he was also a
realist and depended largely upon tricks for his
results. He had felt the great value of what
he liked to term legitimate advertising, and he
was fond of saying to himself that any scheme
would succeed if properly set before the world.
He regarded it a maxim that anything which
can be clearly described is a fact. His realism was
the gospel of success, he declared, and needed
but to be stated to be adopted by all the world.</p>

<p>From the first he saw how his hotel was to be
an intellectual focus; moreover he designed to
have it radiate its own glory like a star set upon
Mt. Boab.</p>

<p>The difficulties inherent in this project were
from the first quite apparent to Mr. Gaslucky,
but he was full of expedients and cunning. He
had come out of the lowest stratum of life, fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
his way up to success, and his knowledge of
human nature was accurate if not very broad.</p>

<p>Early in the summer, about the first days of
June, in fact, certain well-known and somewhat
distinguished American authors received by
due course of mail an autograph letter from
Mr. Gaslucky, which was substantially as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cincinnati, O.</span>, May 30, 1887.</p>

<p class="sal">My dear Sir:</p>

<p>The Hotel Helicon, situated on the Lencadian
promontory, far up the height of Mt. Boab
and overlooking the glorious valley of the Big
Mash River, amid the grandest scenery of the
Cumberland Mountains, where at their southern
extremity they break into awful peaks, chasms
and escarpments, is now thrown open to a few
favored guests for the summer. The proprietor
in a spirit of liberality (and for the purpose of
making this charming hotel known to a select
public) is issuing a few special invitations to
distinguished people to come and spend the
summer free of charge. You are cordially and
urgently invited. The Hotel Helicon is a place
to delight the artist and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litterateur</i>. It is
high, airy, cool, surrounded by wild scenes, good
shooting and fishing at hand, incomparable mineral
springs, baths, grottos, dark ravines and
indeed everything engaging to the imagination.
The proprietor will exhaust effort to make his
chosen guests happy. The rooms are new,
sweet, beautifully furnished and altogether comfortable,
and the table will have every delicacy
of the season served in the best style. There
will be no uninvited guests, all will be chosen
from the most exalted class. Come, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
one season taste the sweets of the dews of Helicon,
without money and without price.</p>

<p>If you accept this earnest and cordial invitation,
notify me at once. Hotel Helicon is at
your command.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">Truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">Isaiah R. Gaslucky.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It is needless to say that this letter was the
product of a professional advertising agent
employed for the occasion by the proprietor of
Hotel Helicon. The reader will observe the
earmarks of the creation and readily recognize
the source. Of course, when the letter was
addressed to a woman there was a change, not
only in the gender of the terms, but in the tone,
which took on a more persuasive color. The
attractions of the place were described in more
poetic phrasing and a cunningly half-hidden
thread of romance, about picturesque mountaineers
and retired and reformed bandits, was
woven in.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, each individual who received
this rather uncommon letter, read it
askance, at first, suspecting a trick, but the
newspapers soon cleared the matter up by announcing
that Mr. Isaiah Gaslucky, of Cincinnati,
had &ldquo;conceived the happy idea of making
his new and picturesque Hotel Helicon free this
season to a small and select company of distinguished
guests. The hotel will not be open to
the public until next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass that in midsummer
such a company as never before was assembled,
met on Mt. Boab and made the halls of Hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Helicon gay with their colors and noisy with
their mirth. The woods, the dizzy cliffs, the bubbling
springs, the cool hollows, the windy peaks
and the mossy nooks were filled with song, laughter,
murmuring under-tones of sentiment, or
something a little sweeter and warmer, and there
were literary conversations, and critical talks, and
jolly satire bandied about, with some scraps of
adventure and some bits of rather ludicrous mishap
thrown in for variety.</p>

<p>Over all hung a summer sky, for the most
part cloudless, and the days were as sweet as
the nights were delicious.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the afternoon of a breezy day, at the time
when the shadows were taking full possession
of the valley, the coach arrived at Hotel Helicon
from the little railway station at the foot of
Mt. Boab.</p>

<p>A man, the only passenger, alighted from his
perch beside the driver and for a moment stood
as if a little dazed by what he saw.</p>

<p>He was very short, rather round and stout,
and bore himself quietly, almost demurely. His
head was large, his feet and hands were small
and his face wore the expression of an habitual
good humor amounting nearly to jolliness,
albeit two vertical wrinkles between his brows
hinted of a sturdy will seated behind a heavy
Napoleonic forehead. The stubby tufts of
grizzled hair that formed his mustaches shaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a mouth and chin at once strong and pleasing.
He impressed the group of people on the hotel
veranda most favorably, and at once a little
buzz of inquiry circulated. No one knew
him.</p>

<p>That this was an important arrival could not
be doubted; it was felt at once and profoundly.
Great men carry an air of individuality about
with them; each, like a planet, has his own
peculiar atmosphere by which his light is modified.
There was no mistaking the light in this
instance; it indicated a luminary of the first
magnitude.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the guests at Hotel Helicon
were not required to record their names in a
register, therefore the new comer could bide his
own time to make himself known.</p>

<p>Miss Alice Moyne, of Virginia, the beautiful
young author of two or three picturesque short
stories lately published in a popular magazine,
was in conversation with Hartley Crane, the
rising poet from Kentucky, just at the moment
when this new arrival caused a flutter on the
veranda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do wonder if he can be Edgar De
Vere?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hartley Crane, &ldquo;I have seen De
Vere; he is as large and as fascinating as his
romances. That little pudgy individual could
never make a great romantic fiction like <cite>Solway
Moss</cite>, by De Vere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is a superb head,&rdquo; whispered Miss
Moyne, &ldquo;the head of a master, a genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are heads and heads, genius
and genius,&rdquo; replied Crane. &ldquo;I guess the
new-comer off as a newspaper man from Chicago
or New York. It requires first-class genius
to be a good reporter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger under discussion was now giving
some directions to a porter regarding his luggage.
This he did with that peculiar readiness,
or sleight, so to call it, which belongs to none but
the veteran traveler. A moment later he came
up the wooden steps of the hotel, cast a comprehensive
but apparently indifferent glance over
the group of guests and passed into the hall,
where they heard him say to the boy in waiting:
&ldquo;My room is 24.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the reserved room,&rdquo; remarked two
or three persons at once.</p>

<p>Great expectations hung about room 24;
much guessing had been indulged in considering
who was to be the happy and exalted person
chosen to occupy it. Now he had arrived,
an utter stranger to them all. Everybody
looked inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be Mark Twain,&rdquo; suggested little
Mrs. Philpot, of Memphis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; Mark Twain is tall, and very handsome;
I know Mark,&rdquo; said Crane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Moyne, and
when everybody laughed, she colored a little
and added hastily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that it was strange that Mr.
Crane should know Mr. Twain, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>They drowned her voice with their laughter
and hand-clapping.</p>

<p>They were not always in this very light mood
at Hotel Helicon, but just now they all felt in
a trivial vein. It was as if the new guest had
brought a breath of frivolous humor along with
him and had blown it over them as he passed by.</p>

<p>Room 24 was the choice one of Hotel Helicon.
Every guest wanted it, on account of
its convenience, its size and the superb view its
windows afforded; but from the first it had been
reserved for this favored individual whose arrival
added greater mystery to the matter.</p>

<p>As the sun disappeared behind the western
mountains, and the great gulf of the valley
became a sea of purplish gloom, conversation
clung in half whispers to the subject who meantime
was arraying himself in evening dress for
dinner, posing before the large mirror in room
24 and smiling humorously at himself as one
who, criticising his own foibles, still holds to
them with a fortitude almost Christian.</p>

<p>He parted his hair in the middle, but the line
of division was very slight, and he left a pretty,
half-curled short wisp hanging over the centre
of his forehead. The wide collar that hid his
short neck creased his heavy well-turned jaws,
giving to his chin the appearance of being
propped up. Although he was quite stout, his
head was so broad and his feet so small that he
appeared to taper from top to toe in a way that
emphasized very forcibly his expression of
blended dignity and jollity, youth and middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
age, sincerity and levity. When he had finished
his toilet, he sat down by the best window in the
best room of Hotel Helicon, and gazed out over
the dusky valley to where a line of quivering
silver light played fantastically along the line
of peaks that notched the delicate blue of the
evening sky. The breeze came in, cool and
sweet, with a sort of champagne sparkle in its
freshness and purity. It whetted his appetite
and blew the dust of travel out of his mind.
He was glad when the dinner hour arrived.</p>

<p>The long table was nearly full when he went
down, and he was given a seat between Miss Moyne
and little Mrs. Philpot. By that secret cerebral
trick we all know, but which none of us can explain,
he was aware that the company had just
been discussing him. In fact, someone had
ventured to wonder if he were Mr. Howells,
whereupon Mr. Crane had promptly said that
he knew Mr. Howells quite well, and that
although in a general way the new-comer was
not unlike the famous realist, he was far from
identical with him.</p>

<p>Laurens Peck, the bushy-bearded New England
critic, whispered in someone&rsquo;s ear that it
appeared as if Crane knew everybody, but that
the poet&rsquo;s lively imagination had aided him
more than his eyes, in all probability. &ldquo;Fact
is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a Kentuckian soon gets so that
he <em>thinks</em> he has been everywhere and seen
everybody, whether he has or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out of this remark grew a serious affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which it will be my duty to record at the proper
place.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Philpot, who wore gold eye-glasses
and had elongated dimples in her cheeks and
chin, dexterously managed to have a word or
two with the stranger, who smiled upon her
graciously without attempting to enter into a
conversation. Miss Moyne fared a little better,
for she had the charm of grace and beauty to
aid her, attended by one of those puffs of good
luck which come to none but the young and the
beautiful. Mr. B. Hobbs Lucas, a large and
awkward historian from New York, knocked
over a bottle of claret with his elbow, and the
liquor shot with an enthusiastic sparkle diagonally
across the table in order to fall on Miss
Moyne&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>With that celerity which in very short and
stout persons appears to be spontaneous, a sort
of elastic quality, the gentleman from room 24
interposed his suddenly outspread napkin. The
historian flung himself across the board after
the bottle, clawing rather wildly and upsetting
things generally. It was but a momentary
scene, such as children at school and guests at a
summer hotel make more or less merry over,
still it drew forth from the genial man of room
24 a remark which slipped into Miss Moyne&rsquo;s
ear with the familiarity of well trained humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A deluge of wine in a free hotel!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
just above a whisper. &ldquo;Such generosity
is nearly shocking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you mention it,&rdquo; said Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Moyne, with her brightest and calmest smile;
&ldquo;I have been idealizing the place. A gush of
grape-juice on Helicon is a picturesque thing to
contemplate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a lap-full of claret on Mt. Boab is not
so fine, eh? What a farce poetry is! What a
humbug is romance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The historian had sunk back in his chair and
was scowling at the purple stain which kept
slowly spreading through the fiber of the cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always do something,&rdquo; he sighed, and his
sincerity was obvious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And always with <em>aplomb</em>,&rdquo; remarked little
Mrs. Philpot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a genius who could knock over
a claret bottle with grace,&rdquo; added Peck. &ldquo;Now
a jug of ale&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was present at table once with Mr. Emerson,&rdquo;
began the Kentucky poet, but nobody
heard the rest. A waiter came with a heavy
napkin to cover the stain, and as he bent over
the table he forced the man from room 24 to
incline very close to Miss Moyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of making an instance of Emerson!&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;Emerson who died before
he discovered that men and women have
to eat, or that wine will stain a new dress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then he discovered so many things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please mention one of them,&rdquo; he glibly interrupted.
&ldquo;What did Emerson ever discover?
Did he ever pen a single truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Aloft in secret veins of air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blows the sweet breath of song,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">she replied. &ldquo;He trod the very headlands of
truth. But you are not serious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she checked
herself, recollecting that she was speaking to a
stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not serious but emphatically in earnest,&rdquo; he
went on, in the same genial tone with which he
had begun. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a thing but cunning
phrase-form in anything the man ever wrote.
He didn&rsquo;t know how to represent life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; Miss Moyne ventured, &ldquo;you are
a realist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey any adequate idea
of the peculiar shade of contempt she conveyed
through the words. She lifted her head a little
higher and her beauty rose apace. It was as if
she had stamped her little foot and exclaimed:
&ldquo;Of all things I detest realism&mdash;of all men, I hate
realists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I kept the wine off your dress!&rdquo; he
urged, as though he had heard her thought.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing good but what is real. Romance
is lie-tissue. Reality is truth-tissue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Permit me to thank you for your good
intentions,&rdquo; she said, with a flash of irony;
&ldquo;you held the napkin just in the right position,
but the wine never fell from the table.
Still your kindness lost nothing in quality
because the danger was imaginary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When dinner was over, Miss Moyne sought
out Hartley Crane, the Kentucky poet who
knew everybody, and suggested that perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the stranger was Mr. Arthur Selby, the analytical
novelist whose name was on everybody&rsquo;s
tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Arthur Selby is thin and bald and has
a receding chin. I met him often at the&mdash;I
forget the club in New York,&rdquo; said Crane.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more likely that he&rsquo;s some reporter. He&rsquo;s
a snob, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, no, not a snob, Mr. Crane; he is the
most American man I ever met,&rdquo; replied Miss
Moyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Americans are the worst of all snobs,&rdquo;
he insisted, &ldquo;especially literary Americans.
They adore everything that&rsquo;s foreign and pity
everything that&rsquo;s home-made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this he was remembering how
Tennyson&rsquo;s and Browning&rsquo;s poems were overshadowing
his own, even in Kentucky. From
the ring of his voice Miss Moyne suspected
something of this sort, and adroitly changed the
subject.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might be imagined that a hotel full of
authors would be sure to generate some flashes
of disagreement, but, for a time at least, everything
went on charmingly at Hotel Helicon.
True enough, the name of the occupant of room
24 remained a vexatious secret which kept
growing more and more absorbing as certain
very cunningly devised schemes for its exposure
were easily thwarted; but even this gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
gentleman a most excellent excuse for nagging
the ladies in regard to feminine curiosity and
lack of generalship. Under the circumstances
it was not to be expected that everybody
should be strictly guarded in the phrasing of
speech, still so genial and good-humored was
the nameless man and so engaging was his way
of evading or turning aside every thrust, that he
steadily won favor. Little Mrs. Philpot, whose
seven year old daughter (a bright and sweet
little child) had become the pet of Hotel Helicon,
was enthusiastic in her pursuit of the
stranger&rsquo;s name, and at last she hit upon a plan
that promised immediate success. She giggled
all to herself, like a high-school girl, instead of
like a widow of thirty, as she contemplated certain
victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now do you think you can remember,
dear?&rdquo; she said to May, the child, after having
explained over and over again what she wished
her to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeth,&rdquo; said May, who lisped charmingly in
the sweetest of child voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what must you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I muth thay: Pleathe write your&mdash;your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Autograph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeth, your au&mdash;to&mdash;graph in my album.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, autograph, autograph, don&rsquo;t
forget. Now let me hear you say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleathe write your autograph in my book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Philpot caught the child to her breast
and kissed it vigorously, and not long afterward
little May went forth to try the experiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
She was armed with her mother&rsquo;s autograph
album. When she approached her victim he
thought he never had seen so lovely a child.
The mother had not spared pains to give most
effect to the little thing&rsquo;s delicate and appealing
beauty by an artistic arrangement of the shining
gold hair and by the simplest but cunningest
tricks of color and drapery.</p>

<p>With that bird-like shyness so winning in a
really beautiful little girl, May walked up to
the stranger and made a funny, hesitating
courtesy. He looked at her askance, his smiling
face shooting forth a ray of tenderness
along with a gleam of shrewd suspicion, as he
made out the album in her dimpled little
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, little one,&rdquo; he said cheerily.
&ldquo;Have you come to make a call?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out both hands and looked so kindly
and good that she smiled until dimples just like
her mother&rsquo;s played over her cheeks and chin.
Half sidewise she crept into his arms and held
up the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleathe write your photograph in my
book,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>He took her very gently on his knee, chuckling
vigorously, his heavy jaws shaking and
coloring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you to come?&rdquo; he inquired, with
a guilty cunning twinkle in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mama told me,&rdquo; was the prompt answer.</p>

<p>Again the man chuckled, and, between the
shame he felt for having betrayed the child and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
delight at the success of his perfidy, he grew
quite red in the face. He took the autograph
album and turned its stiff, ragged-edged leaves,
glancing at the names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is your mama&rsquo;s book, is it?&rdquo; he
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeth it is,&rdquo; said May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I must write my name in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, your&mdash;your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;member.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a stylographic pen
and dashed a picturesque sign manual across a
page.</p>

<p>While the ink was drying he tenderly kissed
the child&rsquo;s forehead and then rested his chin on
her bright hair. He could hear the clack of
balls and mallets and the creak of a lazy swing
down below on the so-called lawn, and a hum
of voices arose from the veranda. He looked
through the open window and saw, as in a
dream, blue peaks set against a shining rim
of sky with a wisp of vultures slowly wheeling
about in a filmy, sheeny space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mama said I muthn&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; apologized the
child, slipping down from his knee, which she
had found uncomfortably short.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together from a diffused
state of revery and beamed upon her again with
his cheerful smile.</p>

<p>She turned near the door and dropped another
comical little courtesy, bobbing her curly head
till her hair twinkled like a tangle of starbeams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
on a brook-ripple, then she darted away, book
in hand.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Philpot snatched the album from
May, as she ran to her, and greedily rustled the
leaves in search of the new record, finding
which she gazed at it while her face irradiated
every shade of expression between sudden
delight and utter perplexity. In fact she could
not decipher the autograph, although the handwriting
surely was not bad. Loath as she
naturally was to sharing her secret with her
friends, curiosity at length prevailed and she
sought help. Everybody in turn tried to make
out the two short words, all in vain till Crane,
by the poet&rsquo;s subtle vision, cleared up the mystery,
at least to his own satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gaspard Dufour is the name,&rdquo; he asserted,
with considerable show of conscious superiority.
&ldquo;A Canadian, I think. In fact I imperfectly
recall meeting him once at a dinner given by
the Governor General to Lord Rosenthal at
Quebec. He writes plays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another romance out of the whole cloth by
the Bourbon æsthete!&rdquo; whispered the critic.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such a Canadian as Gaspard
Dufour, and besides the man&rsquo;s a Westerner
rather over-Bostonized. I can tell by his voice
and his mixed manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Hope would know him,&rdquo; suggested
the person addressed. &ldquo;She meets all the Hub
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Literati!</i>&rdquo; snarled the critic, putting an
end to further discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Gaspard Dufour
came down and passed out of the hotel, taking
his way into the nearest ravine. He wore a
very short coat and a slouch hat. In his hand
he carried a bundle of fishing-rod joints. A man
of his build looks far from dignified in such
dress, at best; but nothing could have accentuated
more sharply his absurd grotesqueness of
appearance than the peculiar waddling gait he
assumed as he descended the steep place and
passed out of sight, a fish basket bobbing beside
him and a red kerchief shining around his
throat.</p>

<p>Everybody looked at his neighbor and smiled
inquisitively. Now that they had discovered
his name, the question arose: What had Gaspard
Dufour ever done that he should be accorded
the place of honor in Hotel Helicon. No one
(save Crane, in a shadowy way) had ever heard
of him before. No doubt they all felt a little
twinge of resentment; but Dufour, disappearing
down the ravine, had in some unaccountable
way deepened his significance.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> knows that a mountain hotel has
no local color, no sympathy with its environment,
no gift of making its guests feel that they
are anywhere in particular. It is all very
delightful to be held aloft on the shoulder of a
giant almost within reach of the sky; but the
charm of the thing is not referable to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
definite, visible cause, such as one readily bases
one&rsquo;s love of the sea-side on, or such as accounts
for our delight in the life of a great city. No
matter how fine the effect of clouds and peaks
and sky and gorge, no matter how pure and
exhilarating the air, or how blue the filmy deeps
of distance, or how mossy the rocks, or how
sweet the water, or how cool the wooded vales,
the hotel stands there in an indefinite way, with
no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;etre</i> visible in its make-up, but with
an obvious impudence gleaming from its windows.
One cannot deport one&rsquo;s self at such a
place as if born there. The situation demands&mdash;nay,
exacts behavior somewhat special and
peculiar. No lonely island in the sea is quite
as isolated and out of the world as the top of
any mountain, nor can any amount of man&rsquo;s
effort soften in the least the savage individuality
of mountain scenery so as to render those high
places familiar or homelike or genuinely habitable.
Delightful enough and fascinating enough
all mountain hotels surely are; but the sensation
that living in one of them induces is the
romantic consciousness of being in a degree
&ldquo;out of space, out of time.&rdquo; No doubt this
feeling was heightened and intensified in the
case of the guests at Hotel Helicon who were
enjoying the added novelty of entire freedom
from the petty economies that usually dog the
footsteps and haunt the very dreams of the
average summer sojourner. At all events, they
were mostly a light-hearted set given over to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
freedom of speech and action which would have
horrified them on any lower plane.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Gaspard Dufour passed beyond
sight down the ravine in search of a trout-brook,
than he became the subject of free discussion.
Nothing strictly impolite was said about him;
but everybody in some way expressed amazement
at everybody&rsquo;s ignorance of a man whose
importance was apparent and whose name
vaguely and tauntingly suggested to each one
of them a half-recollection of having seen it in
connection with some notable literary sensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a member of the French institute
by the name of Dufour?&rdquo; inquired R. Hobbs
Lucas, the historian, thoughtfully knitting his
heavy brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure not,&rdquo; said Hartley Crane, &ldquo;for I
met most of the members when I was last at
Paris and I do not recall the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes that Bourbon again,&rdquo; muttered
Laurens Peck, the critic; &ldquo;if one should mention
Xenophon, that fellow would claim a personal
acquaintance with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was plain enough that Peck did not value
Crane very highly, and Crane certainly treated
Peck very coolly. Miss Moyne, however, was
blissfully unaware that she was the cause of this
trouble, and for that matter the men themselves
would have denied with indignant fervor any
thing of the kind. Both of them were stalwart
and rather handsome, the Kentuckian dark and
passionate looking, the New Yorker fair, cool
and willful in appearance. Miss Moyne had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
been pleased with them both, without a special
thought of either, whilst they were going rapidly
into the worry and rapture of love, with no
care for anybody but her.</p>

<p>She was beautiful and good, sweet-voiced,
gentle, more inclined to listen than to talk, and
so she captivated everybody from the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be quite interesting,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;if it should turn out that Mr. Dufour is a
genuine foreign author, like Tolstoï or Daudet
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Realists, and nobody but realists,&rdquo; interposed
Mrs. Philpot; &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you say Zola, and
have done with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Zola, then, if it must be,&rdquo; Miss Moyne
responded; &ldquo;for, barring my American breeding
and my Southern conservatism, I am nearly in
sympathy with&mdash;no, not that exactly, but we
are so timid. I should like to feel a change in
the literary air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you talk just as Arthur Selby writes in
his critical papers. He&rsquo;s all the time trying to
prove that fiction is truth and that truth is fiction.
He lauds Zola&rsquo;s and Dostoieffsky&rsquo;s filthy
novels to the skies; but in his own novels he&rsquo;s as
prudish and Puritanish as if he had been born
on Plymouth Rock instead of on an Illinois
prairie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he is not a guest here,&rdquo; some
one remarked. &ldquo;I should have thought that
our landlord would have had <em>him</em> at all hazards.
Just now Selby is monopolizing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
field of American fiction. In fact I think he
claims the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so easy to assume,&rdquo; said Guilford Ferris,
whose romances always commanded eulogy
from the press, but invariably fell dead on the
market; &ldquo;but I am told that Selby makes
almost nothing from the sales of his books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the magazines pay him handsomely,&rdquo;
said Miss Moyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; replied Ferris, pulling his
long brown mustache reflectively, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t
see why. He really is not popular; there is no
enthusiasm for his fiction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere vogue, begotten by the critics,&rdquo;
said Hartley Crane. &ldquo;Criticism is at a very
low ebb in America. Our critics are all either
ignorant or given over to putting on English
and French airs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferris opened his eyes in a quiet way and
glanced at Peck who, however, did not appear
to notice the remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a set of them in Boston and New
York,&rdquo; Crane went on, &ldquo;who watch the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue
de Deux Mondes</cite> and the London <cite>Atheneum</cite>,
ready to take the cue from them. Even American
books must stand or fall by the turn of
the foreign thumb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a very ancient grumble,&rdquo; said Ferris,
in a tone indicative of impartial indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take these crude, loose, awkward, almost
obscene Russian novels,&rdquo; continued Crane, &ldquo;and
see what a furor the critics of New York and
Boston have fermented in their behalf, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
because it chanced that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</i> of Parisian literary
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roués</i> fancied the filthy imaginings of Dostoieffsky
and the raw vulgarity of Tolstoï.
What would they say of <em>you</em>, Ferris, if <em>you</em>
should write so low and dirty a story as <cite>Crime
and Its Punishment</cite> by Dostoieffsky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, and, begging your grace,
I don&rsquo;t care a straw,&rdquo; Ferris replied; &ldquo;the publishers
would steal all my profits in any event.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that?&rdquo; inquired Peck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe it? I know it,&rdquo; said Ferris. &ldquo;When
did you ever know of a publisher advertising a
book as in its fiftieth thousand so long as the
author had any royalty on the sales? The only
book of mine that ever had a run was one I
sold outright in the manuscript to George Dunkirk
&amp; Co., who publish all my works. That
puerile effort is now in its ninetieth thousand,
while the best of the other six has not yet shown
up two thousand! Do you catch the point?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what difference can printing a statement
of the books sold make, anyway?&rdquo; innocently
inquired Miss Moyne.</p>

<p>Ferris laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the difference in the world,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;the publisher would have to account to the
author for all those thousands, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they have to account, anyhow,&rdquo; replied
Miss Moyne, with a perplexed smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Account!&rdquo; exclaimed Ferris, contemptuously;
&ldquo;account! yes, they have to account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they account to me,&rdquo; Miss Moyne gently
insisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are your publishers?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Dunkirk &amp; Co.,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager you anything I
can come within twenty of guessing the sales up
to date of your book. It has sold just eleven
hundred and forty copies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed merrily and betrayed the dangerous
closeness of his guess by coloring a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, its invariably just eleven hundred and
forty copies, no matter what kind of a book it
is, or what publisher has it,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
investigated and have settled the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The historian was suddenly thoughtful, little
Mrs. Philpot appeared to be making some abstruse
calculation, Crane was silently gazing at
the ground and Peck, with grim humor in his
small eyes, remarked that eleven hundred and
forty was a pretty high average upon the whole.</p>

<p>Just at this point a figure appeared in the little
roadway where it made its last turn lapsing
from the wood toward the hotel. A rather tall,
slender and angular young woman, bearing a
red leather bag in one hand and a blue silk umbrella
in the other, strode forward with the pace
of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tragedienne</i>. She wore a bright silk dress,
leaf-green in color, and a black bonnet, of nearly
the Salvation Army pattern, was set far back on
her head, giving full play to a mass of short,
fine, loosely tumbled yellow hair.</p>

<p>She was very much out of breath from her
walk up the mountain, but there was a plucky
smile on her rather sallow face and an enterprising
gleam in her light eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>She walked right into the hotel, as if she had
always lived there, and they heard her talking
volubly to the servant as she was following him
to a room.</p>

<p>Everybody felt a waft of free Western air and
knew that Hotel Helicon had received another
interesting guest, original if not typical, with
qualities that soon must make themselves
respected in a degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walked from the station?&rdquo; Mrs. Philpot
ventured, in querulous, though kindly interrogation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up the mountain?&rdquo; Miss Moyne added, with
a deprecatory inflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And carried that bag!&rdquo; exclaimed all the
rest.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaspard Dufour</span>, whose accumulations of
adipose tissue appeared to serve him a good
turn, as he descended the steep, rocky ravine,
hummed a droll tune which was broken at intervals
by sundry missteps and down-sittings and
side-wise bumps against the jutting crags. He
perspired freely, mopping his brow meantime
with a vast silk kerchief that hung loosely
about his short neck.</p>

<p>The wood grew denser as he descended and a
damp, mouldy odor pervaded the spaces underneath
the commingling boughs of the oaks,
pines, cedars, and sassafras. Here and there a
lizard scampered around a tree-hole or darted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
under the fallen leaves. Overhead certain
shadowy flittings betrayed the presence of an
occasional small bird, demurely going about its
business of food-getting. The main elements
of the surroundings, however, were gloom and
silence. The breeze-currents astir in the valley
and rippling over the gray peaks of Mt. Boab
could not enter the leafy chambers of this
wooded gorge. Heat of a peculiarly sultry sort
seemed to be stored here, for as Dufour proceeded
he began at length to gasp for breath,
and it was with such relief as none but the suffocating
can fully appreciate, that he emerged
into an open space surrounded, almost, with
butting limestone cliffs, but cut across by a
noisy little stream that went bubbling down
into the valley through a cleft bedecked with
ferns and sprinkled with perennial dew from a
succession of gentle cascades. The ideal trout-brook
was this, so far as appearances could go.
At the foot of each tiny water-fall was a swirling
pool, semi-opaque, giving forth emerald
flashes and silver glints, and bearing little cones
of creamy foam round and round on its bosom.
A thousand noises, every one a water-note, rising
all along the line of the brook&rsquo;s broken current,
clashed together with an effect like that of hearing
a far-off multitude applauding or some
distant army rushing on a charge.</p>

<p>So much out of breath and so deluged with
perspiration was Dufour that he flung himself
upon the ground beside the brook and lay
there panting and mopping his face. Overhead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the bit of sky was like turquoise, below a slender
glimpse of the valley shone between the
rock walls, like a sketch subdued almost to
monochrome of crepuscular purple. A fitful
breath of cool air fell into the place, fanning
the man&rsquo;s almost purple cheeks and forehead,
while a wood-thrush, whose liquid voice might
have been regarded as part of the water-tumult,
sang in a thorn tree hard by.</p>

<p>In a half-reclining attitude, Dufour gave
himself over to the delicious effect of all this,
indulging at the same time in the impolite and
ridiculous, but quite Shakespearian, habit of
soliloquizing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jingo!&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;Jingo! but isn&rsquo;t this
a daisy prospect for trout! If those pools
aren&rsquo;t full of the beauties, then there&rsquo;s nothing
in Waltonian lore and life isn&rsquo;t worth living.
Ha! Jingo! there went one clean above the
water&mdash;a ten ouncer, at least!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sprang at his rod as if to break it to pieces,
and the facility with which he fitted the joints
and the reel and run the line and tied the
cast was really a wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew they were here,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;just
as soon as I laid my eyes on the water. Who
ever did see such another brook!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the third cast of the fly, a brown hackle,
by the way, up came a trout with a somersault
and a misty gleam of royal purple and silver,
attended by a spray of water and a short bubbling
sound. Dufour struck deftly, hooking the
beautiful fish very insecurely through the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the lower lip. Immediately the reel began to
sing and the rod to quiver, while Dufour&rsquo;s eyes
glared almost savagely and his lips pursed with
comical intensity.</p>

<p>Round and round flew the trout, now rushing
to the bottom of the pool, now whisking under
a projecting ledge and anon flinging itself clean
above the water and shaking itself convulsively.</p>

<p>The angler was led hither and thither by his
active prey, the exercise bedewing his face again
with perspiration, whilst his feet felt the cool
bath of water and the soothing embrace of
tangled water-grass. The mere switch of a
bamboo rod, bent almost into a loop, shook like
a rush in a wind.</p>

<p>Dufour was ill prepared to formulate a polite
response when, at the height of his sport, a
gentle but curiously earnest voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snatch &rsquo;im out, snatch &rsquo;im out, dog gone
yer clumsy hide! Snatch &rsquo;im out, er I&rsquo;ll do it
for ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trout must have heard, for as the angler
turned to get a hasty glance at the stranger, up
it leaped and by a desperate shake broke the
snell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound you!&rdquo; cried Dufour, his face redder
than ever. &ldquo;Confound your meddlesome
tongue, why didn&rsquo;t you keep still till I landed
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a tableau set against the gray,
lichen-bossed rocks. Two men glaring at each
other. The new-comer was a tall, athletic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
brown-faced mountaineer, bearing a gun and
wearing two heavy revolvers. He towered
above Dufour and gazed down upon him as if
about to execute him. The latter did not quail,
but grew angrier instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have better sense than to
interfere with my sport in such a way! Who are
you, anyway?&rdquo; he cried in a hot, fierce tone.</p>

<p>The mountaineer stood silent for a moment,
as if collecting words enough for what he felt
like saying, then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;See yer,&rdquo; he drawled, rather musically, &ldquo;ef
I take ye by the scruff o&rsquo; yer neck an&rsquo; the heel
o&rsquo; yer stockin&rsquo; an&rsquo; jest chuck ye inter thet puddle,
ye&rsquo;ll begin to surmise who I air, ye saucy
little duck-legged minny-catcher, you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour, remembering his long training years
ago at the Gentlemen&rsquo;s Glove-Club, squared himself
with fists in position, having flung aside his
tackle. In his righteous rage he forgot that his
adversary was not only his superior in stature
but also heavily armed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, thet&rsquo; ther&rsquo; do beat me!&rdquo; said the
mountaineer, with an incredulous ring in his
voice. &ldquo;The very idee! W&rsquo;y ye little aggervatin&rsquo;
banty rooster, a puttin&rsquo; up yer props at
me! W&rsquo;y I&rsquo;ll jest eternally and everlastin&rsquo;ly
wring yer neck an&rsquo; swob the face o&rsquo; nature wi&rsquo;
ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What followed was about as indescribable as a
whirlwind in dry grass. The two men appeared
to coalesce for a single wild, whirling, resounding
instant, and then the mountaineer went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
over headlong into the middle of the pool with a
great plash and disappeared. Dufour, in a truly
gladiatorial attitude, gazed fiercely at the large
dimple in which his antagonist was buried for
the instant, but out of which he presently
projected himself with great promptness, then, as a
new thought came to him, he seized the fallen
gun of the mountaineer, cocked it and leveled
it upon its owner. There was a peculiar meaning
in his words as he stormed out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie down! down with you, or I blow a hole
clean through you instantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Promptly enough the mountaineer lay down
until the water rippled around his chin and
floated his flaxen beard. Some moments of
peculiar silence followed, broken only by the
lapsing gurgle and murmur of the brook.</p>

<p>Dufour, with arms as steady as iron bars, kept
the heavy gun bearing on the gasping face of
the unwilling bather, whilst at the same time
he was dangerously fingering the trigger. The
stout, short figure really had a muscular and
doughty air and the heavy face certainly looked
warlike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stranger, a seein&rsquo; &rsquo;at ye&rsquo;ve got the drap onto
me, &rsquo;spose we swear off an&rsquo; make up friends?&rdquo;
The man in the water said this at length, in the
tone of one presenting a suggestion of doubtful
propriety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hardly think you&rsquo;ve cooled off sufficiently,
do you?&rdquo; responded Dufour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here&rsquo;s spring warter, ye must &rsquo;member,&rdquo;
offered the mountaineer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The gun was beginning to tire Dufour&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do you knock under?&rdquo; he inquired,
still carelessly fumbling the trigger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great mind ter say yes,&rdquo; was the shivering
response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, take your time to consider, I&rsquo;m in no
hurry,&rdquo; said Dufour.</p>

<p>If the man in the water could have known
how the supple but of late untrained arms of
the man on shore were aching, the outcome
might have been different; but the bath was
horribly cold and the gun&rsquo;s muzzle kept its
bearing right on the bather&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give in, ye&rsquo;ve got me, stranger,&rdquo; he at last
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Dufour was mightily relieved as he put down
the gun and watched his dripping and shivering
antagonist wade out of the cold pool. The men
looked at each other curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re the dog gone&rsquo;dest man &rsquo;at ever I see,&rdquo;
remarked the mountaineer; &ldquo;who air ye, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a pretty good fellow, if you take
me on the right tack,&rdquo; said Dufour.</p>

<p>The other hesitated a moment, and then
inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air ye one o&rsquo; them people up at the tavern
on the mounting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boardin&rsquo; there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all summer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Again there was a silence, during which the
water trickled off the mountaineer&rsquo;s clothes and
ran over the little stones at his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; ter make fun o&rsquo; me when ye git up
thar?&rdquo; the catechism was at length resumed.
Dufour laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could tell a pretty good thing on you,&rdquo;
he answered, taking a sweeping observation of
the stalwart fellow&rsquo;s appearance as he stood
there with his loose jeans trousers and blue
cotton shirt clinging to his shivering limbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See yer, now,&rdquo; said the latter, in a wheedling
tone, and wringing his light, thin beard
with one sinewy dark hand, &ldquo;see yer, now, I&rsquo;d
like for ye not ter do thet, strenger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the mountaineer, after some
picturesque hesitation and faltering, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause I
hev a &rsquo;quaintance o&rsquo; mine up ther&rsquo; at thet
tavern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, have you? Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe ye mought be erquainted with Miss
Sarah Anna Crabb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s up ther&rsquo;, she stayed all night at
our house las&rsquo; night an&rsquo; went on up ther&rsquo; this
mornin&rsquo;; she&rsquo;s a literary woman an&rsquo; purty, an&rsquo;
smart, an&rsquo; a mighty much of a talker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest tell her &rsquo;at ye met me down yer, an&rsquo;
&rsquo;at I&rsquo;m tol&rsquo;ble well; but don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout
this &rsquo;ere duckin&rsquo; &rsquo;at ye gi&rsquo; me, will ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Dufour hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to say, feeling an indescribable thrill of
sympathy for the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer&rsquo;s my hand, strenger, an&rsquo; w&rsquo;en Wesley
Tolliver gives a feller his hand hit means all
there air ter mean,&rdquo; exclaimed the latter, as
warmly as his condition would permit, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
w&rsquo;en ye need er friend in these parts jest come
ter me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shouldered his gun, thereupon, and
remarking that he might as well be going,
strode away over a spur of the mountain, his
clothes still dripping and sticking close to his
muscular limbs. Dufour found his rod broken
and his reel injured, by having felt the weight
of Wesley Tolliver&rsquo;s foot, and so he too turned
to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>Such an adventure could not fail to gain in
spectacular grotesqueness as it took its place in
the memory and imagination of Dufour. He
had been in the habit of seeing such things on
the stage and of condemning them out of hand
as the baldest melodramatic nonsense, so that
now he could not fairly realize the matter as
something that had taken place in his life.</p>

<p>He was very tired and hungry when he
reached Hotel Helicon.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, yes, I walked all the way up the mountain
from the railroad depot,&rdquo; explained the
young woman whose arrival we chronicled in
another chapter, &ldquo;but I stopped over night at a
cabin on the way and discovered some just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
delightful characters&mdash;the Tollivers&mdash;regular
Craddock sort of people, an old lady and her
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By some method known only to herself she
had put herself upon a speaking-plane with
Dufour, who, as she approached him, was standing
in an angle of the wide wooden veranda
waiting for the moon to rise over the distant
peaks of the eastern mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Mr. Tolliver to-day while whipping
a brook down here,&rdquo; said he, turning to
look her squarely in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you! Isn&rsquo;t he a virile, villainous,
noble, and altogether melodramatic looking
man? I wish there was some one here who
could sketch him for me. But, say, Mr.
Dufour, what do you mean, please, when you
speak of <em>whipping</em> a brook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took from her pocket a little red note-book
and a pencil as he promptly responded:
&ldquo;Whipping a brook? oh, that&rsquo;s angler&rsquo;s nonsense,
it means casting the line into the water,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; she remarked, making a
note.</p>

<p>She was taller than Dufour, and so slender
and angular that in comparison with his excessive
plumpness she looked gaunt and bony. In
speaking her lips made all sorts of wild contortions
showing her uneven teeth to great effect,
and the extreme rapidity of her utterance gave
an explosive emphasis to her voice. Over her
forehead, which projected, a fluffy mass of pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
yellow hair sprang almost fiercely as if to
attack her scared and receding chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are from Michigan, I believe, Miss
Crabb,&rdquo; remarked Dufour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; she answered, growing red
in the face, &ldquo;No, indeed. I am from Indiana,
from Ringville, associate editor of the <cite>Star</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, I meant Indiana. Of course I knew
you were not from Michigan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; with a little laugh and a shrug,
&ldquo;I am glad you see the point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I usually do&mdash;a little late,&rdquo; he remarked
complacently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are from Boston, then, I infer,&rdquo; she
glibly responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not precisely,&rdquo; he said, with an approving
laugh, &ldquo;but I admit that I have some Bostonian
qualities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation she was
drooping over him, so to say, and he was
sturdily looking up into her bright, insistent
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a group!&rdquo; said Crane to Mrs. Bridges,
a New York fashion editor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give the
best farm in Kentucky (so far as my title goes)
for a photograph of it! Doesn&rsquo;t she appear to
be just about to peck out his eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lofty imagination plays you fantastic
tricks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bridges. &ldquo;Is she the famous
Western <em>lady</em> reporter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same, of the <cite>Ringville Star</cite>. I met her
at the Cincinnati convention. It was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that Bascom of the <cite>Bugle</cite> called her a bag of
gimlets, because she bored him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This exclamation was not in response to what
Crane had said, but it was an involuntary tribute
to the moon-flower just flaring into bloom
between twin peaks lying dusky and heavy
against the mist of silver and gold that veiled
the sweet sky beyond. A semi-circle of pale
straw-colored fire gleamed in the lowest angle
of the notch and sent up long, wavering lines of
light almost to the zenith, paling the strongest
stars and intensifying the shadows in the mountain
gorges and valleys. Grim as angry gods,
the pines stood along the slopes, as if gloomily
contemplating some dark scheme of vengeance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A real Sapphic,&rdquo; said Crane, dropping into
a poetical tone, as an elocutionist does when he
is hungry for an opportunity to recite a favorite
sketch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why a Sapphic?&rdquo; inquired the matter-of-fact
fashion-editor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you remember that fragment, that
glorious picture Sappho&rsquo;s divine genius has
made for us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He quoted some Greek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About as divine as Choctaw or Kickapoo,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I understand the moon-shine better.
In fact I have a sincere contempt for all this
transparent clap-trap you poets and critics
indulge in when you got upon your Greek hobby.
Divine Sappho, indeed! A lot of bald bits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
jargon made famous by the comments of fogies.
Let&rsquo;s look at the moon, please, and be sincere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sincere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you know very well that if you had
written the Sapphic fragments the critics
would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The critics! What of them? They are a
set of disappointed poetasters themselves. Blind
with rage at their own failures, they snap right
and left without rhyme or reason. Now there&rsquo;s
Peck, a regular&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, a regular <em>what</em>?&rdquo; very coolly
demanded the critic who had stepped forth from
a shadowy angle and now stood facing Crane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A regular star-gazer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bridges.
&ldquo;Tell us why the planets yonder all look so
ghastly through the shimmering moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peck, without reply, turned and walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he offended?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he gives offence, but can not take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges grew silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were speaking of Sappho,&rdquo; observed
Crane, again gliding into an elocutionary mood.
&ldquo;I have translated the fragment that I repeated
a while ago. Let me give it to you.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;When on the dusky violet sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The full flower of the moon blooms high<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stars turn pale and die!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Just then Miss Moyne, dressed all in white,
floated by on Peck&rsquo;s arm, uttering a silvery gust
of laughter in response to a cynical observation of
the critic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lovely girl she is,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bridges. &ldquo;Mr. Peck shows fine critical acumen
in being very fond of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crane was desperately silent. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a handsome
man, too, and I suspect it&rsquo;s a genuine love
affair,&rdquo; Mrs. Bridges went on, fanning herself
complacently. Back and forth, walking slowly
and conversing in a soft minor key, save when
now and then Miss Moyne laughed melodiously,
the promenaders passed and repassed, Peck
never deigning to glance toward Crane, who had
forgotten both Sappho and the moon. Miss
Moyne did, however, once or twice turn her eyes
upon the silent poet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; went on Miss Crabb, filling Dufour&rsquo;s
ears with the hurried din of her words, &ldquo;Oh,
I&rsquo;m going to write a novel about this place. I
never saw a better chance for local color, real
transcripts from life, original scenes and genuine
romance all tumbled together. Don&rsquo;t you think
I might do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does appear tempting,&rdquo; said Dufour.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Tolliver for instance, a genuine Chilhowee
moonshiner.&rdquo; He appeared to laugh
inwardly as he spoke. Indeed he heard the
plash of water and the dripping, shivering
mountaineer stood forth in his memory down
there in the gorge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A moonshiner!&rdquo; gasped Miss Crabb, fluttering
the leaves of her note-book and writing
by moonlight with a celerity that amazed
Dufour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Potentially, at least,&rdquo; he replied evasively.
&ldquo;He looks like one and he don&rsquo;t like water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he <em>does</em> turn out to be a real moonshiner,&rdquo;
Miss Crabb proceeded reflectively to say, &ldquo;it
will be just too delicious for anything. I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you, confidentially, Mr. Dufour,
that I am to write some letters while here to the
<cite>Chicago Daily Lightning Express</cite>. So I&rsquo;d take
it as a great favor if you&rsquo;d give me all the points
you get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting,&rdquo; he said, with a keen
scrutiny of her face for a second. &ldquo;I shall be
glad to be of assistance to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a movement to go, but lingered to
say: &ldquo;Pray give me all the points, too, will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you a journalist too?&rdquo; she inquired,
breathlessly hanging over him. &ldquo;What paper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of anything,&rdquo; he hurriedly
interposed, &ldquo;but I like to know what is going
on, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked away without further excuse and
went up to his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to watch him,&rdquo; soliloquized Miss
Crabb, &ldquo;or he&rsquo;ll get the scoop of all the news.
Give him points, indeed! Maybe so, but not
till after I&rsquo;ve sent them to the <cite>Lightning Express</cite>!
I&rsquo;ll keep even with him, or know the
reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a grand panorama that the climbing
moon lighted up all around Mount Boab, a vast
billowy sea of gloom and sheen. Here were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
shining cliffs, there dusky gulches; yonder the
pines glittered like steel-armed sentinels on the
hill-tops, whilst lower down they appeared to
skulk like cloaked assassins. Shadows came
and went, now broad-winged and wavering,
again slender and swift as the arrows of death.
The hotel was bright within and without.
Some one was at the grand piano in the hall
making rich music&mdash;a fragment from Beethoven,&mdash;and
a great horned owl down the ravine
was booming an effective counterpoint.</p>

<p>Crane stood leaning on the railing of the veranda
and scowling savagely as Peck and Miss Moyne
continued to promenade and converse. He was,
without doubt, considering sinister things. Mrs.
Bridges, finding him entirely unsympathetic,
went to join Miss Crabb, who was alone where
she had been left by Dufour. Meantime, up in
his room, with his chair tilted far back and his
feet thrust out over the sill of an open window,
Dufour was smoking a fragrant Cuban cigar,
(fifty cents at retail) and alternating smiles with
frowns as he contemplated his surroundings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Authors,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;are the silliest, the
vainest, and the most impractical lot of human
geese that ever were plucked for their valuable
feathers. And newspaper people! Humph!&rdquo;
He chuckled till his chin shook upon his immaculate
collar. &ldquo;Just the idea, now, of that
young woman asking me to furnish her with
points!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something almost jocund blent
with his air of solid self-possession, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
smoked the precious cigars one after another
with prodigal indifference and yet with the perfect
grace of him to the manner born.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hotel Helicon on Mt. Boab!&rdquo; he repeated,
and then betook himself to bed.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> people are born to find things out&mdash;to
overhear, to reach a place just at the moment in
which an event comes to pass there&mdash;born
indeed, with the news-gatherer&rsquo;s instinct perfectly
developed. Miss Crabb was one of these.
How she chanced to over-hear some low-spoken
but deadly sounding words that passed between
Peck and Crane, it would be hard to say; still
she overheard them, and her heart jumped
almost into her mouth. It was a thrillingly dramatic
passage, there under the heavy-topped oak
by the west veranda in the gloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; exclaimed Crane, in the hissing
voice of a young tragedy-player at rehearsal,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Villain! you shall not escape me. Defend
yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Peck, &ldquo;you talk like a fool.
I don&rsquo;t want to fight! What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got
in your hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sword, you cowardly craven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call me a coward! If I had a good
club I should soon show you what I could do, you
sneaking assassin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>More words and just as bitter followed, till at
last a fight was agreed upon to take place immediately,
at a certain point on the verge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
cliff not far away. There were to be no seconds
and the meeting was to end in the death of one
or both of the combatants.</p>

<p>To Miss Crabb all this had a sound and an
appearance as weird as anything in the wildest
romance she ever had read. It was near mid-night;
the hotel was quite soundless and the
moon on high made the shadows short and
black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet me promptly at the Eagle&rsquo;s Nest in
ten minutes,&rdquo; said Crane, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch my other
sword and give you choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; responded Peck, &ldquo;but a club
would do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peculiar hollowness of their voices
affected the listener as if the sounds had come
from a tomb. She felt clammy. Doubtless
there is a considerable element of humorous,
almost ludicrous bravado in such a scene when
coolly viewed; but Miss Crabb could not take
a calm, critical attitude just then. At first she
was impelled almost irresistibly toward interfering
and preventing a bloody encounter; but
her professional ambition swept the feeling
aside. Still, being a woman, she was dreadfully
nervous. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; she shuddered, &ldquo;it will be
just awful, but I can&rsquo;t afford to miss getting the
full particulars for the <cite>Lightning Express</cite>. A
sure enough duel! It will make my fortune!
Oh, if I were a man, now, just only for a few
hours, what a comfort it would be! But all the
same I must follow them&mdash;I must see the encounter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
describe it as an eye-witness and send
it by wire early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It occurred to her mind just then that the
nearest telegraph station was twelve miles down
the mountain, but she did not flinch or waver.
The thought that she was required to do what
a man might well have shrunk from gave an
element of heroism to her pluck. She was conscious
of this and went about her task with an
elasticity and facility truly admirable.</p>

<p>Eagle&rsquo;s Nest was the name of a small area on
the top of a beetling cliff whose almost perpendicular
wall was dotted with clumps of
sturdy little cedar trees growing out of the
chinks. It was a dizzy place at all times, but
by night the effect of its airy height was very
trying on any but the best nerves. Crane and
Peck both were men of fine physique and were
possessed of stubborn courage and great combativeness.
They met on the spot and after
choosing swords, coolly and promptly proceeded
to the fight. On one hand, close to the cliff&rsquo;s
edge, was a thick mass of small oak bushes, on
the other hand lay a broken wall of fragmentary
stones. The footing-space was fairly good,
though a few angular blocks of stone lay here
and there, and some brushes of stiff wood-grass
were scattered around.</p>

<p>Crane led with more caution than one would
have expected of an irate Kentuckian, and Peck
responded with the brilliant aplomb of an
enthusiastic duelist.</p>

<p>The swords were neither rapiers nor broad-swords,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
being the ordinary dress-weapons worn
by Confederate Infantry officers in the war
time&mdash;weapons with a history, since they had
been at the thigh of father and son, the bravest
of Kentucky Cranes, through many a stormy
battle.</p>

<p>Peck&rsquo;s back was toward the precipice-brink
at the commencement of the engagement, but
neither had much the advantage, as the moon
was almost directly overhead. As their weapons
began to flash and clink, the slender keen
echoes fell over into the yawning chasm and
went rattling down the steep, ragged face of the
precipice. They were vigorous and rather good
fencers and it would have been evident to an onlooker
of experience that the fight was to be a
long one, notwithstanding the great weight of
the swords they were using. They soon began
to fight fiercely and grew more vehemently
aggressive each second, their blows and thrusts
and parries and counter-cuts following each
other faster and faster until the sounds ran together
and the sparks leaped and shone even in
the bright moonlight. They mingled broad-sword
exercise with legitimate rapier fencing
and leaped about each other like boxers, their
weapons whirling, darting, rising, falling, whilst
their breathing became loud and heavy. It
was a scene to have stirred the blood of men
and women four hundred years ago, when love
was worth fighting for and when men were quite
able and willing to fight for it.</p>

<p>The combatants strained every point of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
strength and skill, and not a drop of blood could
either draw. Slash, thrust, whack, clink, clank,
clack, click, cling! Round and round they
labored, the fury of their efforts flaming out of
their eyes and concentrating in the deep lines of
their mouths. As if to listen, the breeze lay
still in the trees and the great owl quit hooting
in the ravine. Faster and faster fell the blows,
swifter and keener leaped the thrusts, quicker
and surer the parries were interposed. The
swords were hacked and notched like hand-saws,
the blades shook and hummed like lyre-cords.
Now close to the cliff&rsquo;s edge, now over by the
heap of broken stones and then close beside the
clump of oak bushes, the men, panting and
sweating, their muscles knotted, their sinews
leaping like bow-strings, their eyes standing out,
as if starting from their sockets, pursued each
other without a second&rsquo;s rest or wavering.</p>

<p>At last, with an irresistible spurt of fury,
Crane drove Peck right into the bushes with a
great crash and would not let him out. The
critic was not vanquished, however, for, despite
the foliage and twigs, he continued to parry and
thrust with dangerous accuracy and force.</p>

<p>Just at this point a strange thing happened.
Right behind Peck there was a tearing, crashing
sound and a cry, loud, keen, despairing, terrible,
followed immediately by the noise of a body
descending among the cedars growing along the
face of the awful precipice.</p>

<p>It was a woman&rsquo;s voice, shrieking in deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
horror that then came up out of the dizzy depth
of space below!</p>

<p>The men let fall their swords and leaped to
the edge of the cliff with the common thought
that it was Miss Moyne who had fallen over.
They reeled back giddy and sick, staggering as
if drunken.</p>

<p>Far down they had seen something white
fluttering and gleaming amid a tuft of cedars
and a quavering voice had cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help, help, oh, help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the duel was at an end.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Hotel Helicon</span> was shaken out of its sleep by
the startling rumor to the effect that Miss Moyne
had fallen down the precipice at Eagle&rsquo;s Nest.</p>

<p>Of all the rudely awakened and mightily
frightened inmates, perhaps Miss Moyne herself
was most excited by this waft of bad news. She
had been sleeping very soundly in dreamless
security and did not at first feel the absurdity
of being told that she had just tumbled down
the escarpment, which in fact she never yet had
summoned the courage to approach, even when
sustained by a strong masculine arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O dear! how did it happen?&rdquo; she demanded
of her aunt, Mrs. Coleman Rhodes, who had
rushed upon her dainty couch with the frightful
announcement of her accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Alice! you are here, you are not hurt
at all! Oh!&rdquo; Mrs. Rhodes went on, &ldquo;and what
<em>can</em> it all mean!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody rushed out, of course, as soon as
hurried dressing would permit, and fell into the
confusion that filled the halls and main veranda.</p>

<p>Crane was talking in a loud, but well modulated
strain, explaining the accident:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Peck and I,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;were
enjoying a friendly turn at sword-play up here
at Eagle&rsquo;s Nest; couldn&rsquo;t sleep, needed exercise,
and went up there so as not to disturb any one.
While we were fencing she came rushing past
through those bushes and leaped right over with
a great shriek. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to talk,&rdquo; cried Mr. E. Hobbs
Lucas, with a directness and clearness quite
unusual in a historian. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to talk,
let&rsquo;s go do something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, come on,&rdquo; quavered poor Peck, his face
whiter than the moon and his beard quivering
in sympathy with his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s dreadful, awful!&rdquo; moaned little Mrs.
Philpot, &ldquo;poor, dear Miss Moyne, to think that
she is gone!&rdquo; and she leaned heavily on Miss
Moyne&rsquo;s shoulder as she spoke.</p>

<p>It was a strange scene, too confused for the
best dramatic effect, but spectacular in the extreme.
Servants swarmed out with lights that
wavered fantastically in the moonshine, while
the huddled guests swayed to and fro in a body.
Every face was pinched with intense excitement
and looked haggard under its crown of disheveled
hair. Even the hotel windows stared in
stupid horror, and the kindly countenances of the
negro waiters took on a bewildered and meaningless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
grin set in a black scowl of superstition
and terror.</p>

<p>When Dufour came upon the scene, he did
not appear in the least flurried, and the first
thing he did was to lay his hand on Miss
Moyne&rsquo;s shoulder and exclaim in a clear tenor
strain:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here! it&rsquo;s all a mistake! What are
you talking about? Here&rsquo;s Miss Moyne! Here
she stands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy! where?&rdquo; enquired little Mrs. Philpot,
who was still leaning on her friend and
shedding bitter tears.</p>

<p>Dufour, with a quiet: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t take
offence,&rdquo; put a hand on either side of Miss
Moyne and lifted her so that she stood in a
chair looking very sweetly down over the crowd
of people.</p>

<p>Few indeed are they who can look beautiful
under such circumstances, but Miss Moyne certainly
did, especially in the eyes of Crane and
Peck as they gazed up at her.</p>

<p>Forthwith the tragedy became a farce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Kentuckian must romance, I suppose,&rdquo;
grumbled R. Hobbs Lucas. &ldquo;Wonder what
he&rsquo;ll tell next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I could be so mistaken,&rdquo;
said Peck, after quiet had been somewhat restored,
&ldquo;I would have willingly been sworn
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a dozen voices hurling
ironical phrases at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is every word truth,&rdquo; exclaimed Crane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
testily. &ldquo;Do you suppose I would trifle with
so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you absolutely know that we suppose
just that very thing?&rdquo; said Lucas.</p>

<p>With the return of self-consciousness the company
began to scatter, the ladies especially
scampering to their rooms with rustling celerity.
The men grumbled not a little, as if being
deprived of a shocking accident touched them
with a sting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grotesque idea!&rdquo; ejaculated Dufour.
&ldquo;Such a practical joke&mdash;impractical joke, I
might better say, could originate only between a
poet and a critic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody went back to bed, feeling more or
less injured by Crane and Peck, who shared in
their own breasts the common impression that
they had made great fools of themselves. If
these crest-fallen knights, so lately militant and
self-confident, had any cause of quarrel now it
was based upon a question as to which should
feel the meaner and which should more deeply
dread to meet Miss Moyne on the morrow.</p>

<p>As for Miss Moyne herself she was indignant
although she tried to quiet her aunt, who
was ready to shake the dust of Mt. Boab from
her feet at once.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, when it was discovered
that Miss Crabb was missing and that after
all something tragic probably had happened,
everybody felt relieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wesley Tolliver</span> might well have served
the turn of romancer or realist, as he stood in
the shadow of a cedar-clump with the mysterious
stillness of midnight all around him. He
was a very real and substantial looking personage,
and yet his gun, his pistols, his fantastic
mountain garb and the wild setting in which he
was framed gave him the appearance of a strong
sketch meant to illustrate a story by Craddock.
Above him towered the cliff at Eagle&rsquo;s Nest and
near by was the mountain &ldquo;Pocket&rdquo; in which
nestled the little distillery whose lurking-place
had long been the elusive dream of utopian
revenue officers. In a space of brilliant moonlight,
Tolliver&rsquo;s dog, a gaunt, brindle cur, sat in
statuesque worthlessness, remembering no doubt
the hares he never had caught and the meatless
bones he had vainly buried during a long ignoble
life.</p>

<p>The hotel and its inmates had rendered the
distillery and its furtive operatives very uneasy
of late, and now as Tolliver in his due turn
stood guard by night he considered the probability
of having to look for some better situation
for his obscure manufactory with a species of
sadness which it would be impossible to describe.
He thought with deep bitterness of all the
annoyance he had suffered at the hands of meddling
government agents and from the outside
world in general and he tried to understand
how any person could pretend to see justice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
such persecution. What had he done to merit
being hunted like a wild beast? Nothing but
buy his neighbor&rsquo;s apples at the fair price of
twenty cents a bushel and distil them into
apple brandy! Could this possibly be any
injury to any government official, or to anybody
else? He paid for his still, he paid for the
apples, he paid fair wages to the men who
worked for him, what more could be justly
demanded of him?</p>

<p>It was while he was wholly absorbed in trying
to solve this knotty problem that far above
a strange clink and clatter began, which sounded
to him as if it were falling from among the
stars. Nothing within his knowledge or experience
suggested an explanation of such a phenomenon.
He felt a thrill of superstitious terror
creep through his iron nerves as the aerial
racket increased and seemed to whisk itself
from place to place with lightning celerity. An
eccentric echo due to the angles and projections
of the cliff added weird effect to the sounds.</p>

<p>The dog uttered a low plaintive whine and
crept close to his master, and even wedged himself
with tremulous desperation between the
knees of that wondering and startled sentinel.</p>

<p>The clinking and clanging soon became loud
and continuous, falling in a cataract down the
escarpment, accompanied now and again by
small fragments of stone and soil.</p>

<p>At last Tolliver got control of himself sufficiently,
and looked out from his shadowy station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and up towards the dizzy crown of Eagle&rsquo;s
Nest.</p>

<p>Just at that moment there was a crash and a
scream. He saw a wide-winged, ghostly object
come over the edge and swoop down. Another
scream, another and another, a tearing sound, a
crushing of cedar boughs, a shower of small
stones and lumps of soil.</p>

<p>Tolliver, frightened as he never before had
been, turned and fled, followed by his ecstatic
dog.</p>

<p>A voice, keen, clear, high, beseeching pursued
him and reached his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! help! Oh, help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely this was the &ldquo;Harnt that walks Mt.
Boab!&rdquo; This syren of the mountains had lured
many a hunter to his doom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, me! Oh, my! Oh, mercy on me!
Help! help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tolliver ran all the faster, as the voice seemed
to follow him, turn as he would. He bruised
his shins on angular rocks, he ran against trees,
he fell over logs, and at last found himself hopelessly
entangled in a net of wild grape-vines,
with his enthusiastic dog still faithfully wriggling
between his knees.</p>

<p>The plaintive voice of the syren, now greatly
modified by distance, assailed his ears with
piteous persistence, as he vainly struggled to
free himself. The spot was dark as Erebus,
being in the bottom of a ravine, and the more
he exerted himself the worse off he became.</p>

<p>It was his turn to call for help, but if any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his friends heard they did not heed his supplications,
thinking them but baleful echoes of the
Harnt&rsquo;s deceitful voice.</p>

<p>It was at the gray of dawn when at last Tolliver
got clear of the vines and made his way
out of the ravine. By this time he had entirely
overcome his fright, and with that stubbornness
characteristic of all mountain men, he betook
himself back to the exact spot whence he had
so precipitately retreated. His dog, forlornly
nonchalant, trotted behind him to the place and
resumed the seat from which the Harnt had
driven him a few hours ago. In this attitude,
the animal drooped his nose and indifferently
sniffed a curious object lying near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thet ther&rsquo; thing, Mose?&rdquo; inquired
Tolliver, addressing the dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll ber dorg-goned!&rdquo; he added, as he
picked up a woman&rsquo;s bonnet. &ldquo;If this here
don&rsquo;t beat the worl&rsquo; an&rsquo; all camp meetin&rsquo;! Hit
air&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll ber dorged&mdash;hit air&mdash;I&rsquo;m er ghost
if hit aint Miss Sara&rsquo; Anna Crabb&rsquo;s bonnet, by
Ned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held it up by one silk string and gazed at
it with a ludicrously puzzled stare. The dog
whined and wagged his tail in humble sympathy
with his master&rsquo;s bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s kinder interestin&rsquo;, haint it, Mose?&rdquo;
Tolliver went on dryly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hev ter look
inter this here thing, won&rsquo;t we, Mose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for Mose, he was looking into it with all
his eyes. Indeed he was beginning to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
extreme interest, and his tail was pounding the
ground with great rapidity.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought leaped into Tolliver&rsquo;s
brain and with a start he glanced up the escarpment,
his mouth open and his brown cheeks
betraying strong emotion. Mose followed his
master&rsquo;s movements with kindling eyes, and
whined dolefully, his wolfish nose lifted almost
vertically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Tolliver?&rdquo; fell a voice
out of a cedar clump a little way up the side
of the cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit air me,&rdquo; he responded, as he saw Miss
Crabb perched among the thick branches. She
had her little red note-book open and was
writing vigorously. Her yellow hair was disheveled
so that it appeared to surround her
face with a flickering light which to Tolliver&rsquo;s
mind gave it a most beautiful and altogether
lovely expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll ber&mdash;&rdquo; he checked himself and
stood in picturesque suspense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Tolliver, won&rsquo;t you please help
me down from here?&rdquo; she demanded, closing
her note-book and placing her pencil behind
her ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully cramped, sitting in this
position so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chivalrous mountaineer did not wait to
be appealed to a second time, but laying down
his gun to which he had clung throughout the
night, he clambered up the steep face of the
rock, from projection to projection, until he
reached the tree in which Miss Crabb sat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Meantime she watched him with admiring eyes
and just as he was about to take her in his
arms and descend with her she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, I might lose the thought,
I&rsquo;ll just jot it down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took her note-book and pencil again and
hurriedly made the following entry: <i>Sinewy,
virile, lithe, hirsute, fearless, plucky, bronzed, vigorous,
lank, Greek-eyed, Roman-nosed, prompt,
large-eared, typical American. Good hero for
dramatic, short, winning dialect story. The
magazines never refuse dialect stories.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if you please, Mr. Tolliver, I will go
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an Herculean labor, but Tolliver was
a true hero. With one arm wound around her,
after the fashion of the serpent in the group of the
Laocoön, and with her long yellow hair streaming
in crinkled jets over his shoulder, he slowly
made his way down to the ground.</p>

<p>Meantime Mose, the dog, with true canine
sympathy and helpfulness, had torn the bonnet
into pathetic shreds, and was now lying half
asleep under a tree with a bit of ribbon in his
teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll jest ber&mdash;beg parding Miss Crabb,
but thet ther dog hev et up yer head-gear,&rdquo;
said Tolliver as he viewed with dilating eyes
the scattered fragments.</p>

<p>She comprehended her calamity with one
swift glance, but she had caught a new dialect
phrase at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Head-gear, you call it, I believe?&rdquo; she
inquired, again producing book and pencil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg parding all over, Miss Crabb, I meant
bonnet,&rdquo; he hurried to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right, I assure you,&rdquo; she replied,
writing rapidly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a delightfully fresh and
artistic bit of special coloring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Crabb&rsquo;s clothes were badly torn and she
looked as if she had spent the night wretchedly,
but with the exception of a few slight scratches
and bruises she was unhurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well jes&rsquo; look a there, will ye!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tolliver as he spied Mose. There was more of
admiration than anger in his voice. &ldquo;Ef thet
ther &rsquo;fernal dog haint got yer chin-ribbon in his
ole mouth, I&rsquo;m er rooster!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chin-ribbon,&rdquo; repeated Miss Crabb, making
a note, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m er rooster,&rdquo; and she smiled with
intense satisfaction. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, Mr.
Tolliver, how much I am indebted to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a tall, Miss Crabb, not a tall. Don&rsquo;t
mention of it,&rdquo; he humbly said, &ldquo;hit taint wo&rsquo;th
talkin&rsquo; erbout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning was in full blow now and the
cat-birds were singing sweetly down the ravine.
Overhead a patch of blue sky gleamed and
burned with the true empyrean glow. Far
away, down in the valley by the little river, a
breakfast horn was blown with many a mellow
flourish and a cool gentle breeze with dew on
its wings fanned Miss Crabb&rsquo;s sallow cheeks
and rustled Tolliver&rsquo;s tawny beard. At the
sound of the horn Mose sprang to his feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
loped away with the bit of ribbon fluttering
from his mouth.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in the forenoon before it was discovered
at Hotel Helicon that Miss Crabb was
missing, and even then there arose so many
doubts about the tragic side of the event that
before any organized search for her had been
begun, she returned, appearing upon the scene
mounted behind Wesley Tolliver on a small,
thin, wiry mountain mule.</p>

<p>Crane and Peck each drew a deep, swift sigh
of relief upon seeing her, for the sense of guilt
in their breasts had been horrible. They had
by tacit conspiracy prevented any examination
of Eagle&rsquo;s Nest, for they dreaded what might be
disclosed. Of course they did not mean to hide
the awful fate of the poor girl, nor would they
willingly have shifted the weight of their dreadful
responsibility, but it was all so much like a
vivid dream, so utterly strange and theatrical
as it arose in their memories, that they could
not fully believe in it.</p>

<p>Miss Crabb looked quite ludicrous perched
behind the tall mountaineer on such a dwarfish
mule. Especially comical was the effect of the
sun-bonnet she wore. She had accepted this
article of apparel from Tolliver&rsquo;s mother, and it
appeared to clutch her head in its stiff folds and
to elongate her face by sheer compression.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed involuntarily, as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for joy at her safe return as in response to the
demand of her melodramatic appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brung back yer runerway,&rdquo; said Tolliver
cheerily, as he helped the young woman to
dismount. &ldquo;She clim down the mounting by
one pertic&rsquo;ler trail an&rsquo; I jes&rsquo; fotch her up by
t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Crabb spoke not a word, but ran into
the hotel and up to her room without glancing
to the right or to the left. In her great haste
the stiff old sun-bonnet fell from her head and
tumbled upon the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wush ye&rsquo;d jes&rsquo; be erbligin&rsquo; enough ter han&rsquo;
thet there head-gear up ter me, Mister,&rdquo; said
Tolliver addressing Crane, who was standing
near. &ldquo;My mammy&rsquo;d raise er rumpage ef I&rsquo;d
go back &rsquo;thout thet ther bonnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With evident reluctance and disgust Crane
gingerly took up the fallen article and gave it
to Tolliver, who thanked him so politely that
all the onlooking company felt a glow of admiration
for the uncouth and yet rather handsome
cavalier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thet gal,&rdquo; he observed, glancing in the
direction that Miss Crabb had gone, &ldquo;she hev
the winnin&rsquo;est ways of any gal I ever seed in
my life. Ye orter seen &rsquo;er up inter thet there
bush a writin&rsquo; in &rsquo;er book! She&rsquo;d jes&rsquo; tumbled
kerwhummox down the clift an&rsquo; hed lodged
ther&rsquo; in them cedars; but as she wer&rsquo; a writin&rsquo;
when she started ter fall w&rsquo;y she struck a
writin&rsquo; an&rsquo; jes&rsquo; kep&rsquo; on at it same&rsquo;s if nothin&rsquo; had
happened. She&rsquo;s game, thet ole gal air, I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
ye! She don&rsquo;t propose for any little thing like
fallin&rsquo; off&rsquo;n a clift, ter interfere with w&rsquo;at she&rsquo;s
a doin&rsquo; at thet time, le&rsquo; me say ter ye. Lord
but she wer&rsquo; hongry, though, settin&rsquo; up ther a
writin&rsquo; all night, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;d a done ye good to a seen
&rsquo;er eat thet chicken and them cake-biscuits my
mammy cooked for breakfast. She air a mos&rsquo;
alarmin&rsquo; fine gal, for a fac&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point Dufour came out of the hotel,
and when Tolliver saw him there was an instantaneous
change in the expression of the mountaineer&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll ber dorged!&rdquo; he exclaimed with
a smile of delight, &ldquo;ef ther&rsquo; haint the same
leetle John the Baptis&rsquo; what bapsonsed me down
yer inter the branch! Give us yer baby-spanker,
ole feller! How air ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour cordially shook hands with him,
laughing in a jolly way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fust an&rsquo; only man at ever ducked me, I&rsquo;m
here ter say ter ye,&rdquo; Tolliver went on, in a
cheery, half-bantering tone, and sitting sidewise
on the mule. &ldquo;Ye mus&rsquo; hev&rsquo; a sight o&rsquo; muscle
onto them duck legs and bantam arms o&rsquo;
your&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had the last word still in his mouth when
the little beast suddenly put down its head and
flung high its hind feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woirp!&rdquo; they heard him cry, as he whirled
over in the air and fell sprawling on the
ground.</p>

<p>Dufour leaped forward to see if the man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
hurt, but Tolliver was upright in an instant and
grinning sheepishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s right, Bonus,&rdquo; he said to the mule
which stood quite still in its place, &ldquo;thet&rsquo;s right
ole fel, try ter ac&rsquo; smart in comp&rsquo;ny. Yer a
beauty now, ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He replaced his hat, which had fallen from
his head, patted the mule caressingly on the
neck, then lightly vaulting to the old saddle-tree,
he waved his hand to the company and
turning dashed at a gallop down the mountain
road, his spurs jingling merrily as he
went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a delicious character!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What precious dialect!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How typically American!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A veritable hero!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody at Hotel Helicon appeared to
have been captivated by this droll fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How like Tolstoi&rsquo;s lovely Russians he is!&rdquo;
observed Miss Fidelia Arkwright, of Boston, a
near-sighted maiden who did translations and
who doted on virile literature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was in Russia, I visited Tolstoi at
his shoe-shop&mdash;&rdquo; began Crane, but nobody
appeared to hear him, so busy were all in making
notes for a dialect story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tolstoi is the greatest fraud of the nineteenth
century,&rdquo; said Peck. &ldquo;That shoe-making pretence
of his is about on a par with his genius in
genuineness and sincerity. His novels are
great chunks of raw filth, rank, garlic garnished
and hideous. We touch them only because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
French critics have called them savory. If the
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue de Deux Mondes</cite> should praise a Turkish
novel we could not wait to read it before we
joined in. Tolstoi is remarkable for two things:
his coarseness and his vulgar disregard of
decency and truth. His life and his writings are
alike crammed with absurdities and contradictory
puerilities which would be laughable but
for their evil tendencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir, how then do you account
for the many editions of Tolstoi&rsquo;s books?&rdquo;
inquired the historian, R. Hobbs Lucas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as I account for the editions of Cowper
and Montgomery and Wordsworth and even
Shakespeare,&rdquo; responded Peck. &ldquo;You put a ten
per cent. author&rsquo;s royalty on all those dear classics
and see how soon the publishers will quit
uttering them! If Tolstoi&rsquo;s Russian raw meat
stories were put upon the market in a fair competition
with American novels the latter
would beat them all hollow in selling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we ought to have international copyright,&rdquo;
plaintively exclaimed a dozen voices,
and so the conversation ended.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, each one of the company
in growing silent did so in order to weigh certain
suggestions arising out of Peck&rsquo;s assertions.
It was as if a score of semi-annual statements
of copyright accounts were fluttering in the
breeze, and it was as if a score of wistful
voices had whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How in the world do publishers grow rich
when the books they publish never sell?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps Gaspard Dufour should be mentioned
as appearing to have little sympathy with
Peck&rsquo;s theory or with the inward mutterings it
had engendered in the case of the rest of the
company.</p>

<p>If there was any change in Dufour&rsquo;s face it
was expressed in a smile of intense self-satisfaction.</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was, of course, not long that the newspapers
of our wide-awake country were kept from giving
their readers very picturesque glimpses of
what was going on among the dwellers on Mt.
Boab. The humorists of the press, those charming
fellows whose work is so enjoyable when
performed upon one&rsquo;s neighbor and so excruciating
when turned against oneself, saw the vulnerable
points of the situation and let go a
broadside of ridicule that reverberated from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. It became a matter of
daily amusement among the inmates of Hotel
Helicon to come together in little groups and
discuss these humorous missiles fired upon
them from California, Texas, Arkansas and
Wisconsin, from Brooklyn, Pittsburgh, Atlanta,
and Oil-City, Detroit and&mdash;, but from everywhere,
indeed.</p>

<p>When it came to Miss Crabb&rsquo;s adventure,
every humorist excelled himself in descriptive
smartness and in cunning turns of ironical
phrasing. The head-line experts did telling
work in the same connection. All this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
perfectly understood and enjoyed at home, but
foreigners, especially the English, stubbornly
insisted upon viewing it as the high-water
mark of American refinement and culture.</p>

<p>When that genial periodical, the Smartsburgh
<cite>Bulldozer</cite>, announced with due gravity that
Miss Crabb, a Western journalist, had leaped
from the top of Mt. Boab to the valley below,
and had been caught in the arms of a stalwart
moonshiner, where she safely reposed, etc., the
London <cite>Times</cite> copied the paragraph and made
it a text for a heavy editorial upon the barbaric
influences of Republican institutions, to which
the American Minister felt bound to advert in
a characteristic after-dinner speech at a London
club. So humorous, however, were his remarks
that he was understood to be vigorously in
earnest, and the result was perfect confirmation
of the old world&rsquo;s opinion as to the rudimentary
character of our national culture.</p>

<p>Meantime Hotel Helicon continued to be the
scene of varied if not startling incidents. In
their search for local color and picturesque
material, the litterateurs invaded every nook
and corner of the region upon and round about
Mt. Boab, sketching, making notes, recording
suggestions, studying dialect, and filling their
minds with the uncouth peculiarities of the
mountain folk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has come to this,&rdquo; grumbled Peck, &ldquo;that
American literature, its fiction I mean, is
founded on dialect drivel and vulgar yawp.
Look at our magazines; four-fifths of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
short stories are full of negro talk, or cracker
lingo, or mountain jibberish, or New England
farm yawp, or Hoosier dialect. It is horribly
humiliating. It actually makes foreigners think
that we are a nation of green-horns. Why, a
day or two ago I had occasion to consult the
article on American literature in the Encyclopædia
Britannica and therein I was told in one
breath how great a writer and how truly American
Mr. Lowell is, and in the next breath I
was informed that a poem beginning with the
verse, &lsquo;Under the yaller pines I house&rsquo; is one of
his master-pieces! Do you see? Do you catch
the drift of the Englishman&rsquo;s argument? To
be truly great, <em>as an American</em>, one must be surpassingly
vulgar, even in poetry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This off-hand shower of critical observation
had as little effect upon the minds of Peck&rsquo;s
hearers as a summer rain has on the backs of a
flock of ducks. They even grew more vehement
in their pursuit of local color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was spending a month at Rockledge
castle with Lord Knownaught,&rdquo; said Crane,
&ldquo;his lordship frequently suggested that I should
make a poem on the life of Jesse James.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo; inquired
Miss Crabb with a ring of impatience in her
voice, &ldquo;if you had you might have made a hit.
You might have attracted some attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour laughed heartily, as if he had caught
some occult humor from the young woman&rsquo;s
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I did write it,&rdquo; said Crane retrospectively,
&ldquo;and sent it to George Dunkirk &amp; Co.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; sighed Miss Crabb with intense
interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Crane, &ldquo;they rejected the MS.
without reading it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Dufour laughed, as if at a good joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Dunkirk &amp; Co.!&rdquo; cried Guilford
Ferris, the romancer, &ldquo;George Dunkirk &amp; Co.!
They are thieves. They have been making
false reports on copyright to me for five years or
more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour chuckled as if his jaws would fall off,
and finally with a red face and gleaming
humorous eyes got up from the chair he was
filling on the veranda, and went up to his
room.</p>

<p>The rest of the company looked at one another
inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he, anyhow?&rdquo; demanded Peck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just my query,&rdquo; said Ferris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody in the house knows anything definite
about him,&rdquo; remarked R. Hobbs Lucas.
&ldquo;And yet he evidently is a distinguished person,
and his name haunts me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it does me,&rdquo; said Miss Moyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s a newspaper reporter. His
cheek proves that,&rdquo; remarked Peck.</p>

<p>Miss Crabb made a note, her own cheek
flaming. &ldquo;I presume you call that humor,&rdquo;
she observed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about like New York&rsquo;s best
efforts. In the West reporters are respectable
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; Peck said hastily, &ldquo;I did
not mean to insinuate that anybody is not respectable.
Everybody is eminently respectable if I
speak of them. I never trouble myself with
the other kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe that Mr. Dufour is a
reporter at all,&rdquo; replied Miss Crabb, with emphasis,
&ldquo;for he&rsquo;s not inquisitive, he don&rsquo;t make
notes, and he don&rsquo;t appear to be writing any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion he&rsquo;s a realist&mdash;a genuine
analytical, motive-dissecting, commonplace-recording,
international novelist in disguise,&rdquo;
said Ferris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be Arthur Selby himself, incog.
Who knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; growled Crane with a lofty
scrowl, &ldquo;I should think I ought to know Selby.
I drank wine with him at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His remark was cut short by the arrival of
the mail and the general scramble that followed.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion the number of newspapers
that fell to the hand of each guest was much
greater than usual, and it was soon discovered
that Miss Crabb&rsquo;s latest letter had been forwarded
to a &ldquo;syndicate&rdquo; and was appearing simultaneously
in ninety odd different journals.</p>

<p>No piece of composition ever was more stunningly
realistic or more impartially, nay,
abjectly truthful than was that letter. It gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a minute account of the quarrel between Peck
and Crane over their attentions to Miss Moyne,
the fight, Miss Crabb&rsquo;s fall, the subsequent
adventures and all the hotel gossip of every
sort. It was personal to the last degree, but it
was not in the slightest libelous. No person
could say that any untruth had been told, or
even that any tinge of false-coloring had been
laid upon the facts as recorded; and yet how
merciless!</p>

<p>Of course Miss Crabb&rsquo;s name did not appear
with the article, save as one of its subjects, and
she saw at once that she had better guard her
secret.</p>

<p>That was a breeze which rustled through
Hotel Helicon. Everybody was supremely
indignant; but there was no clue to the traitor
who had thus betrayed everybody&rsquo;s secrets. It
would be absurd to suppose that Miss Crabb
was not suspected at once, on account of her
constant and superfluous show of note-making,
still there were others who might be guilty.
Crane and Peck were indignant, the former
especially ready to resent to the death any allusion
to the details of the duel. Miss Moyne
with the quick insight of a clever and gifted
young woman, comprehended the situation in
its general terms and was vexed as much as
amused. The whole thing had to her mind the
appearance of a melodramatic, broadly sensational
sketch, in which she had played the part
of the innocent, unconscious, but all-powerful
heroine. Indeed the newspaper account placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
her in this unpleasant attitude before a million
readers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lucky affair for you, Miss Moyne,&rdquo; said
Dufour to her, a few days later, &ldquo;you cannot
over-reckon the boom it will give to your latest
book. You may expect a pretty round sum
with your next copyright statement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke with the voice and air of one who
knew how to read the signs of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the ridiculous idea of having all this
stuff about me going the rounds of the newspapers!&rdquo;
she responded, her beautiful patrician
face showing just a hint of color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care for it a moment,&rdquo; said Dufour,
&ldquo;it will not hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thought of having that hideous picture
in all the patent inside pages of the cheap press,
with my name under it, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en toutes lettres</i>, and&mdash;why
it is horrible!&rdquo; she went on, with trembling
lips.</p>

<p>Dufour smiled upon her, as if indulgently, a
curious, tender gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t allow it to trouble
you. The world discriminates pretty well,
after all. It will not hurt you. It&rsquo;s a mighty
boom for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with a sudden flash in her
cheeks and eyes, and exclaimed almost vehemently:
&ldquo;I will not permit it! They shall not
do it. I cannot bear to be treated as if&mdash;as if
I were a theatrical person&mdash;a variety actress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Moyne,&rdquo; he hurriedly said,
his own face showing a tinge of embarrassment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
&ldquo;you are taking a wrong point of view, indeed
you are. Wait till you see the out-come.&rdquo; His
tone was humble and apologetic as he continued&mdash;&ldquo;My
opinion is that this very thing will
quadruple the sales of your book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them quadrupled,&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;just look at that front hair and that nose!&rdquo;
She held up a newspaper for him to inspect
a picture of herself, a miserable, distorted thing.
&ldquo;It is absolutely disgraceful. My dresses never
fit like that, and who ever saw me with a man&rsquo;s
collar on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears were in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>Dufour consoled her as best he could, though
he could not resist the temptation to suggest
that even a caricature of her face was sure to
have in it the fascination of genuine loveliness,
a suggestion which was phrased with consummate
art and received with an appearance of
innocence that was beyond all art.</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> on Mt. Boab was much like summer
on any other mountain, and life at Hotel Helicon
was very like life at any other mountain hotel,
save that a certain specialization due to the
influence of literature and art was apparent in
the present instance, giving to the house, the
landscape and the intercourse of the guests a
peculiar tinge, so to say, of self-consciousness
and artificiality. Not that these authors, thus
drawn together by the grace of a man grown
suddenly rich, were very different from men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
women of other lines in life, the real peculiarity
sprang out of the obligation by which every
one felt bound to make the most, in a professional
way, of the situation and the environment.
Perhaps there was not a soul under the
broad roof of Hotel Helicon, servants excepted,
that did not secrete in its substance the material
for a novel, a poem, or an essay which was to
brim with the local life and flash with the local
color of the region of Mt. Boab. Yes, there
appeared to be one exception. Dufour constantly
expressed a contempt for the mountaineers and
their country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;to be sure there
is a demand for dialect stories, and I suppose
that they must be written; but for my part I
cannot see why we Americans must stultify
ourselves in the eyes of all the world by flooding
our magazines, newspapers and books with
yawp instead of with a truly characteristic
American literature of a high order. There is
some excuse for a quasi-negro literature, and
even the Creoles might have a niche set apart
for them, but dialect, on the whole, is growing
to be a literary bore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Miss Crabb, drawing
her chin under, and projecting her upper
teeth to such a degree that anything like realistic
description would appear brutal, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you think, Mr. Dufour, that Mr. Tolliver would
make a great character in a mountain romance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. There is nothing great in a clown, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
such,&rdquo; he promptly answered. &ldquo;If Tolliver is
great he would be great without his jargon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but the picturesqueness,
the color, the contrast, you know, would
be gone. Now Craddock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Craddock is excellent, so long as there is but
one Craddock, but when there are some dozens
of him it is different,&rdquo; said Dufour, &ldquo;and it is
the process of multiplication that I object to.
There&rsquo;s Cable, who is no longer a genius of one
species. The writers of Creole stories are swarming
by the score, and, poor old Uncle Remus!
everybody writes negro dialect now. Literary
claim-jumpers are utterly conscienceless. The
book market will soon be utterly ruined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Crabb puffed out her lean sallow cheeks
and sighed heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had hoped,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to get my novel on
the market before this, but I have not yet found
a publisher to suit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She winced inwardly at this way of expressing
the fact that every publisher, high and low,
far and near, had declined her MS. out of hand;
but she could not say the awful truth in its simpliest
terms, while speaking to one so prosperous
as Dufour. She felt that she must at all hazards
preserve a reasonable show of literary independence.
Crane came to her aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One publisher is just as good as another,&rdquo;
he said almost savagely. &ldquo;They are all thieves.
They report every book a failure, save those
they own outright, and yet they all get rich. I
shall publish for myself my next volume.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Dufour smiled grimly and turned away. It
was rather monotonous, this iteration and reiteration
of so grave a charge against the moral
character of publishers, and this threat of Crane&rsquo;s
to become his own publisher was a bit of unconscious
and therefore irresistible humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too pathetic to be laughed at,&rdquo; Dufour
thought, as he strolled along to where Miss
Moyne sat under a tree, &ldquo;but that Kentuckian
actually thinks himself a poet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With all his good nature and kind heartedness,
Dufour could be prejudiced, and he drew
the line at what he called the &ldquo;prevailing tendency
toward boastful prevarication among
Kentucky gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he walked away he heard Crane saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Dunkirk &amp; Co. have stolen at least
twenty thousand dollars in royalties from me
during the past three years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the voice of Ferris that made interrogative
response:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dunkirk your publisher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, or rather my robber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad of it, misery loves company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour half turned about and cast a quick
glance at the speakers. He did not say anything,
however, but resumed his progress toward
Miss Moyne, who had just been joined by Mrs.
Nancy Jones Black, a stoutish and oldish woman
very famous on account of having assumed
much and done little. Mrs. Nancy Jones Black
was from Boston. She was president of the
Woman&rsquo;s Antiquarian Club, of the Ladies&rsquo; Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Association, of The Sappho Patriotic Club, of
the Newport Fashionable Near-sighted Club for
the study of Esoteric Transcendentalism, and it
may not be catalogued how many more societies
and clubs. She was a great poet who had never
written any great poem, a great essayist whom
publishers and editors avoided, whom critics
regarded as below mediocrity, but of whom
everybody stood in breathless awe, and she was
an authority in many literary and philosophical
fields of which she really knew absolutely nothing.
She was a reformer and a person of influence
who had made a large number of her kinsfolk
famous as poets and novelists without any
apparent relevancy between the fame and the
literary work done. If your name were Jones
and you could trace out your relationship to
Mrs. Nancy Jones Black and could get Mrs.
Nancy Jones Black interested in your behalf,
you could write four novels a year with great
profit ever afterward.</p>

<p>As Dufour approached he heard Miss Moyne
say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I publish my poor little works with George
Dunkirk &amp; Co. and the firm has been very kind
to me. I feel great encouragement, but I don&rsquo;t
see how I can bear this horrible newspaper
familiarity and vulgarity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nancy Jones
Black, placing her plump, motherly hand on the
young woman&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;you must not appear to
notice it. Do as did my daughter Lois when
they assailed her first little novel with sugar-plum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
praise. Why, when it began to leak out
that Lois was the author of <cite>A Sea-Side Symphony</cite>
the poor girl was almost smothered with
praise. Of course I had to take the matter in
hand and under my advice Lois went abroad for
six months. When she returned she found herself
famous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking shop?&rdquo; inquired Dufour, accepting
the offer of a place on the bench beside Mrs.
Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, with a comprehensive wave
of her hand, &ldquo;I am taking Miss Moyne under
my wing, so to say, and am offering her the
comfort of my experience. She is a genius
whom it doesn&rsquo;t spoil to praise. She&rsquo;s going to
be the next sensation in the East.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suggested as much to her,&rdquo; said Dufour.
&ldquo;She is already on a strong wave, but she must
try and avoid being refractory, you know.&rdquo; He
said this in a straightforward, business way,
but his voice was touched with a certain sort
of admirable tenderness.</p>

<p>Miss Moyne was looking out over the deep,
hazy valley, her cheeks still warm with the
thought of that newspaper portrait with its
shabby clothes and towsled bangs. What was
fame, bought at such a price! She bridled a
little, but did not turn her head as she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not refractory, I am indignant, and I
have a right to be. They cannot justify the
liberty they have taken, besides I will not
accept notoriety&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, now, dear, that is what Lois said, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Milton John Jones, my nephew, was at first
bound that he wouldn&rsquo;t let Tom, my brother,
advertise him; but he soon saw his way clear,
I assure you, and now he publishes four serials
at once. Be prudent, dear, be prudent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the idea of picturing me with great barbaric
rings in my ears and with a corkscrew
curl on each side and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour interrupted her with a laugh almost
hearty enough to be called a guffaw, and Mrs.
Black smiled indulgently as if at a clever child
which must be led, not driven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being conscious that you really are stylish
and beautiful, you needn&rsquo;t care for the picture,&rdquo;
said Dufour, in a tone of sturdy sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing so effective as a foil,&rdquo;
added Mrs. Black.</p>

<p>Miss Moyne arose and with her pretty chin
slightly elevated walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How beautiful she is!&rdquo; exclaimed Dufour,
gazing after her, &ldquo;and I am delighted to know
that you are taking an interest in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black smiled complacently, and with a
bland sidewise glance at him, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She grows upon one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, with self-satisfied obtuseness,
&ldquo;yes, she is magnetic, she is a genuine
genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely, she stirs one&rsquo;s heart strangely,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have noted that; it&rsquo;s very remarkable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You should speak of it to her at the first
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour started a little, flushed and finally
laughed as one does who discovers a bit of
clever and harmless treachery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only dared,&rdquo; he presently said, with
something very like fervor in his tone. &ldquo;If I
only dared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black looked at him a moment, as if
measuring in her mind his degree of worthiness,
then with a wave of her hand she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never do you dare to dare. Mr. Crane stands
right in your path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour leaped to his feet with the nimbleness
and dangerous celerity of a tiger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crane!&rdquo; he exclaimed with a world of contempt
in his voice, &ldquo;If he&mdash;&rdquo; but he stopped
short and laughed at himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black looked at him with a patronizing
expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; she said, in her most insinuating
tone.</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Crane</span> tried not to show the bitterness he felt
as he saw his hope of winning the favor of Miss
Moyne fading rapidly out, but now and again a
cloud of irresistible melancholy fell upon him.</p>

<p>At such times it was his habit to lean upon
the new fence that circumscribed Hotel Helicon
and dreamily smoke a cigar. He felt a blind
desire to assassinate somebody, if he could only
know who. Of course not Peck, for Peck, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was disconsolate, but somebody, anybody who
would claim the place of a successful rival.</p>

<p>One morning while he stood thus regaling
himself with his tobacco and his misery, Tolliver
rode up, on a handsome horse this time,
and, lifting his broad hat, bowed picturesquely
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good mornin,&rsquo; Kyernel, how&rsquo;re ye this
mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; growled Crane.</p>

<p>Tolliver looked off over the valley and
up at the sky which was flecked with tags of
fleece-cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit look like hit mought rain in er day er
two,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t know, quite likely,&rdquo; said Crane,
gazing evasively in another direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever&rsquo;body&rsquo;s well, I s&rsquo;pose, up ther&rsquo; at the
tavern?&rdquo; inquired Tolliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; was the cold answer.</p>

<p>Tolliver leaned over the pommel of his
saddle-tree and combed his horse&rsquo;s mane with
his sinewy fingers. Meantime the expression
in his face was one of exceeding embarrassment
blent with cunning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kyernel, c&rsquo;u&rsquo;d ye do a feller a leetle yerrent
what&rsquo;s of importance?&rdquo; he asked with peculiar
faltering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; inquired Crane lifting his eye-brows
and turning the cigar in his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest a leetle frien&rsquo;ly job o&rsquo; kindness,&rdquo; said
Tolliver, &ldquo;jest ter please ask thet young leddy&mdash;thet
Miss Crabb &rsquo;at I fotch up yer on er mule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
tother day, ye know; well, jest ax her for me ef
I moughtn&rsquo;t come in an&rsquo; see &rsquo;er on pertic&rsquo;lar an&rsquo;
pressin&rsquo; business, ef ye please, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the mountaineer&rsquo;s embarrassment
had become painfully apparent. Any good
judge of human nature could have seen at once
that he was almost overcome with the burden and
worry of the matter in hand. His cheeks were
pale and his eyes appeared to be fading into utter
vacancy of expression. Crane told him that
there was no need to be particularly formal, that
if he would go in and ask for Miss Crabb she
would see him in the parlor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Kyernel, hit&rsquo;s er private, sort er confidential
confab &rsquo;at I must hev wi&rsquo; &rsquo;er, an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all right, you&rsquo;ll not be interrupted
in the parlor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air ye pine blank shore of it, Kyernel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead shore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crane had become interested in Tolliver&rsquo;s
affair, whatever it might be. He could not
keep from sharing the man&rsquo;s evident intensity
of mood, and all the time he was wondering
what the matter could be. Certainly no common-place
subject could so affect a man of iron
like Tolliver. The poet&rsquo;s lively imagination
was all aglow over the mystery, but it could
not formulate any reasonable theory of explanation.</p>

<p>Miss Crabb appeared in the parlor promptly
and met Tolliver with a cordiality that, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of reassuring him, threw him into another
fit of embarrassment from which he at first
made no effort to recover. His wide-brimmed
hat, as he twirled it on his knees, quivered convulsively
in accord with the ague of excitement
with which his whole frame was shaking. He
made certain soundless movements with his lips,
as if muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Miss Crabb at first did not notice his confusion,
and went on talking rapidly, reiterating
thanks for the kindness he had shown her in her
recent mishap, and managing to put into her
voice some tones that to him sounded very tender
and sweet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know&mdash;you can&rsquo;t imagine, Mr.
Tolliver, what I suffered during that awful
night,&rdquo; she said, turning her head to one side
and drawing her chin under until it almost disappeared
in the lace at her throat. &ldquo;It was horrible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tolliver looked at her helplessly, his mouth
open, his eyes dull and sunken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to discover me up there,
anyway, Mr. Tolliver?&rdquo; she demanded, leaning
toward him and laughing a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dog he treed ye, an&rsquo; then I seed ye settin&rsquo;
up ther&rsquo; er writin&rsquo; away,&rdquo; he managed to say, a
wave of relief passing over his face at the sound
of his own voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was perfectly ridiculous, perfectly preposterous,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m mighty
thankful that I was not hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, well ye mought be, Miss Crabb,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
stammered out. &ldquo;Wonder ye wasn&rsquo;t scrunched
inter pieces an&rsquo; scattered all eround ther&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped out her book, took a pencil from
over her ear and made a note.</p>

<p>Tolliver eyed her dolefully. &ldquo;How do you
spell scrunched, Mr. Tolliver, in your dialect?&rdquo;
she paused to inquire.</p>

<p>His jaw fell a little lower for a moment, then
he made an effort:</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&mdash;q&mdash;r&mdash;u&mdash;&rdquo; he paused and shook his
head, &ldquo;S&mdash;q&mdash;k&mdash;no thet&rsquo;s not hit&mdash;s&mdash;k&mdash;q&mdash;r&mdash;dorg
ef I ken spell thet word&mdash;begging
yer parding, hit air &rsquo;tirely too hard for me.&rdquo;
He settled so low in his chair that his knees
appeared almost as high as his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she cheerily exclaimed, &ldquo;I can
get it phonetically. It&rsquo;s a new word. I don&rsquo;t
think either Craddock or Johnson uses it, it&rsquo;s
valuable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence during which Miss Crabb
thoughtfully drummed on her projecting front
teeth with the end of her pencil.</p>

<p>Tolliver nerved himself and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Crabb I&mdash;I, well, ye know, I&mdash;that is,
begging yer parding, but I hev something&rsquo; I
want er say ter ye, ef ye please.&rdquo; He glanced
furtively around, as if suspecting that some
person lay secreted among the curtains of a bay
window hard by. And indeed, Dufour was
there, lightly indulging in a morning nap, while
the mountain breeze flowed over him. He was
in a deep bamboo chair behind those very curtains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, certainly, Mr. Tolliver, go on,
I shall be delighted, charmed indeed, to hear
what you have to say,&rdquo; Miss Crabb responded,
turning a fresh leaf of her note-book and putting
on a hopeful look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;ll stick ter thet after I&rsquo;ve done
said it ter ye,&rdquo; he proceeded to say, &ldquo;but dorg
on me ef I know how ter begin sayin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just go right on, it&rsquo;s all right; I assure
you, Mr. Tolliver, I am very anxious to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe ye air, I don&rsquo;t dispute yer word,
but I feel mighty onery all the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Onery is a Western word,&rdquo; mused Miss
Crabb, making a note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proceed, Mr. Tolliver,&rdquo; she continued after
a pause, &ldquo;proceed, I am listening with great
interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m ergwine ter state ter ye mought
mek ye mad, but hit can&rsquo;t be holp, I jest hev
ter say it&mdash;I air jest erbleeged ter say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice was husky and he was assuming a
tragic air. Miss Crabb felt a strange thrill
creep throughout her frame as a sudden suspicion
seemed to leap back and forth between her
heart and her brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I assure you that I could not be angry
with you, Mr. Tolliver, under any circumstances,&rdquo;
she murmured, &ldquo;you have been so
very kind to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit air awful confusin&rsquo; an&rsquo; hit mek a feller
feel smaller &rsquo;n a mouse ter speak it right out,
but then hit air no foolishness, hit air pine
blank business.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Miss Crabb pensively,
&ldquo;of course you feel some embarrassment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hitched himself up in his chair and crossed
his legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ef ye don&rsquo;t like w&rsquo;at I say, w&rsquo;y I won&rsquo;t
blame ye a bit. I feel jest as if I wer a doin&rsquo;
somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;at I hadn&rsquo;t orter do, but my mammy
she say I must, an&rsquo; that do everlastin&rsquo;ly settle
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your mother&rsquo;s advice is always safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe, I shed say so! Hit&rsquo;s mighty onsafe
fer me not ter foller it, I kin tell ye. She&rsquo;d
thump my old gourd fer me in ermazin&rsquo; style
ef I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thump my old gourd,&rdquo; repeated Miss Crabb,
making a note. &ldquo;Go on, Mr. Tolliver, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I mought as well, seein&rsquo; &rsquo;at it has
ter be said.&rdquo; He paused, faltered, and then proceeded:
&ldquo;Well, beggin&rsquo; yer parding, Miss
Crabb, but ever sence ye wer&rsquo; down ther&rsquo; ter
we all&rsquo;s cabin, hit&rsquo;s been a worryin&rsquo; my mammy
and me, an&rsquo; we hev&rsquo; talked it all over an&rsquo;
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Miss Crabb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s not the cost of them beads, Miss Crabb,
they air not wo&rsquo;th much, but they was guv ter
mammy by her aunt Mandy Ann Bobus, an&rsquo;
she feel like she jest can&rsquo;t give &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Crabb looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ef ye&rsquo;ll jest erblige me an&rsquo; hand them beads
over ter me, I&rsquo;ll never say er wo&rsquo;d ter nobody
ner nothin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tolliver, what in the world do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
mean?&rdquo; cried Miss Crabb, rising and standing
before him with a face that flamed with sudden
anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye mought er tuck &rsquo;em kinder accidentally,
ye know,&rdquo; he suggested in a conciliatory tone,
rising also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tolliver!&rdquo; she almost screamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ther&rsquo; now, be still, er ye&rsquo;ll let ever&rsquo;body
know all erbout it,&rdquo; he half whispered. &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;d
be disgraceful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tolliver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h! They&rsquo;ll hear ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get right out of this room, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Dufour, who had been slowly
aroused from his nap and who while yet half
asleep had overheard much of what had been
said, stepped forth from behind the curtains and
stood looking from one to the other of the
excited actors in the little drama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he, demanded bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s accusing me of stealing beads!&rdquo; cried
Miss Crabb. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s insulting me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Dufour, glaring at Tolliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel mighty onery a doin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said Tolliver,
&ldquo;but hit air pine blank mighty suspicious,
Kyernel, hit air for a fac&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour looked as if he hardly knew which he
should do, laugh boisterously, or fling Tolliver
out of the window, but he quickly pulled himself
together and said calmly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wrong, sir, and you must apologize.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certingly, certingly,&rdquo; said Tolliver, &ldquo;thet
air jest what I air a doin&rsquo;. I beg parding er
thousan&rsquo; times fer sayin&rsquo; what I hev, but, Kyernel,
hit air a Lor&rsquo; a mighty&rsquo;s truth, all the same,
le&rsquo; me tell ye. Them beads was ther&rsquo; w&rsquo;en she
come, an&rsquo; they was gone w&rsquo;en she was gone,
an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop that! Take back those words or I&rsquo;ll
throw you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dufour took a step towards Tolliver, but
stopped suddenly when the latter drew a huge
revolver with one hand and a long crooked
bowie-knife with the other and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No yer don&rsquo;t, Kyernel, not by er good deal.
Jest ye open yer bread-trap ergain an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll jest
clean up this ole shanty in erbout two minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may not be inferred how this bit of
dramatic experience would have ended had not
a lean, wizzen-faced mountain lad rushed in
just then with a three-cornered piece of paper
in his hand upon which was scrawled the following
message:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hev fown them beeds. They wus in mi
terbacker bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tolliver read this and wilted.</p>

<p>The boy was panting and almost exhausted.
He had run all the way up the mountain from
the Tolliver cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer mammy say kum home,&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit air jest as I &rsquo;spected,&rdquo; said Tolliver.
&ldquo;Mammy hev made a pine blank eejit of me
again.&rdquo; He handed the message to Dufour as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he spoke. His pistol and knife had disappeared.</p>

<p>A full explanation followed, and at the end
of a half-hour Tolliver went away crest-fallen
but happy.</p>

<p>As for Miss Crabb she had made a number
of valuable dialect notes.</p>

<p>Dufour promised not to let the rest of the
guests know what had just happened in the
parlor.</p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Literature-making</span> has not yet taken the
rank of a profession, but of late the world has
modified its opinion as to the ability of literary
people to drive a close bargain, or to manage
financial affairs with success. Many women
and some men have shown that it is possible
for a vivid imagination and a brilliant style in
writing to go close along with a practical judgment
and a fair share of selfish shrewdness in
matters of bargain and sale. Still, after all, it
remains true that a strong majority of literary
people are of the Micawber genus, with great
faith in what is to turn up, always nicely balancing
themselves on the extreme verge of
expectancy and gazing over into the promise-land
of fame and fortune with pathetically hopeful,
yet awfully hollow eyes. Indeed there is
no species of gambling more uncertain in its
results or more irresistibly fascinating to its victims
than literary gambling. Day after day,
month after month, year after year, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
deluded, enthusiastic, ever defeated but never
discouraged writer plies his pen, besieges the
publishers and editors, receives their rebuffs,
rough or smooth, takes back his declined manuscripts,
tries it over and over, sweats, fumes,
execrates, coaxes, bullies, raves, re-writes, takes a
new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i> and new courage, goes on and
on to the end. Here or there rumor goes that
some fortunate literator has turned the right
card and has drawn a great prize; this rumor,
never quite authentic, is enough to re-invigorate
all the fainting scribblers and to entice new victims
into the gilded casino of the Cadmean vice.
The man who manipulates the literary machine
is the publisher, that invisible person who usually
grows rich upon the profits of unsuccessful
books. He it is who inveigles the infatuated
young novelist, essayist, or poet, into the beautiful
bunco-den of the book business and there
fastens him and holds him as long as he will
not squeal; but at the first note of remonstrance
he kicks him out and fills his place with a fresh
victim. The literary Micawber, however, does
not despair. He may be a little silly from the
effect of the summersault to which the publisher&rsquo;s
boot has treated him, but after a
distraught look about him he gets up, brushes
the dust off his seedy clothes and goes directly
back into the den again with another manuscript
under his arm and with a feverish faith
burning in his deep-set eyes. What serene and
beautiful courage, by the way, have the literary
women! Of course the monster who presides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
at the publisher&rsquo;s desk cannot be as brutal to
her as he is to men, but he manipulates her
copyright statements all the same, so that her
book never passes the line of fifteen hundred
copies sold. How can we ever account for a
woman who has written forty-three novels under
such circumstances and has died, finally, a
devout Christian and a staunch friend of her
publisher? Poor thing! up to the hour of her
demise, white-haired, wrinkled, over-worked,
nervous and semi-paralytic, she nursed the rosy
hope that to-morrow, or at the very latest, the
day after to-morrow, the reward of all her self-devotion
would come to her in the form of a
liberal copyright statement from her long-suffering
and charitable publisher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out in the West they have a disease called
milk-sickness, an awful malady, of which everybody
stands in deadly terror, but which nobody
has ever seen. If you set out to find a case of
milk-sickness it is like following a <em>will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp</em>,
it is always just a little way farther on,
over in the next settlement; you never find it.
The really successful author in America is, like
the milk-sickness, never visible, except on the
remote horizon. You hear much of him, but
you never have the pleasure of shaking his
cunning right hand. The fact is, he is a myth.
On the other hand, however, the American
cities are full of successful publishers who have
become millionaires upon the profits of books
which have starved their authors. Of course
this appears to be a paradox, but I suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it can be explained by the rule of profit and
loss. The author&rsquo;s loss is the publisher&rsquo;s profit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The foregoing is, in substance, the opening
part of an address delivered by Ferris before the
assembled guests of Hotel Helicon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nancy Jones Black presided at the
meeting; indeed she always presided at meetings.
On this occasion, which was informal and
impromptu, Ferris was in excellent mood for
speaking, as he just had been notified by a letter
from Dunkirk &amp; Co. that he was expected to
pay in advance for the plates of his new romance,
<cite>A Mysterious Missive</cite>, and that a personal check
would not be accepted&mdash;a draft on New York
must be sent forthwith. Although Ferris was
a thoroughly good fellow, who cared nothing
for money as money, this demand for a sum the
half of which he could not command if his life
were at stake, hit him like a bullet-stroke. A
chance to talk off the soreness of the wound was
accepted with avidity. He felt guilty of a
meanness, it is true, in thus stirring up old
troubles and opening afresh ancient hurts in the
breasts of his listening friends; but the relief to
him was so great that he could not forego it. &ldquo;The
American publisher,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;proclaims
himself a fraud by demanding of the author a
contract which places the author&rsquo;s business
wholly in the control of the publisher. I take
it that publishers are just as honest and just as
dishonest, as any other class of respectable men.
You know and I know, that, as a rule, the man
who trusts his business entirely to others will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in the long run, be robbed. Administrators of
estates rob the heirs, in two-thirds of the
instances, as every probate lawyer well knows.
Every merchant has to treat his clerks and salesmen
as if they were thieves, or if he do not they
will become thieves. The government has to
appoint bank examiners to watch the bankers,
and yet they steal. The Indian agents steal
from the government. Senators steal, aldermen
steal, Wall street men steal from one another
and from everybody else. Canada is overflowing
with men who have betrayed and robbed
those who trusted their business with them.
Even clergymen (that poorly paid and much
abused class) now and again fall before the temptation
offered by the demon of manipulated
returns of trust funds. The fact is, one may
feel perfectly safe in saying that in regard
to all the professions, trades, and occupations,
there is absolutely no safety in trusting one&rsquo;s
affairs wholly in the hands of another. (Great
applause). Even your milkman waters the
milk and the dairyman sells you butter that
never was in a churn. If you neglect to keep
a pass-book your grocer runs up the bill to&mdash;(a
great rustle, and some excited whispering) up
to something enormous. Of course it is not
everybody that is dishonest, but experience
shows that if a man has the temptation to
defraud his customers constantly before him,
with absolutely no need to fear detection, he
will soon reason himself into believing it his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
right to have the lion&rsquo;s share of all that goes
into his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t it strange, in view of the premises,
that nobody ever heard of such a thing as a
publisher being convicted of making false
returns? Is it possible that the business of
book-publishing is so pure and good of itself
that it attracts to it none but perfect men?
(Great applause). Publishers do fail financially
once in a while, but their books of accounts
invariably show that just eleven hundred and
forty copies of each copyrighted book on their
lists have been sold to date, no more, no less.
(Suppressed applause). Nobody ever saw
cleaner or better balanced books of accounts
than those kept by the publishers. They foot
up correctly to a cent. Indeed it would be a
very strange thing if a man couldn&rsquo;t make
books balance under such circumstances! (Prolonged
hand-clapping). I am rather poor at
double entry, but I fancy I could make a credit
of eleven hundred and forty copies sold, so as
to have it show up all right. (Cheers). I must
not lose my head in speaking on this subject,
for I cannot permit you to misunderstand
my motive. So long as authors submit to the
per centum method of publication, so long they
will be the prey of the publishers. The only
method by which justice can be assured to both
author and publisher is the cash-sale method.
If every author in America would refuse to let
his manuscript go out of hand before he had
received the cash value for it, the trade would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
soon adjust itself properly. In that case the
author&rsquo;s reputation would be his own property.
So soon as he had made an audience his manuscripts
would command a certain price. If one
publisher would not pay enough for it another
would. As the method now is, it makes little
difference whether the author have a reputation
or not. Indeed most publishers prefer to publish
the novels, for example, of clever tyros,
because these fledglings are so proud of seeing
themselves in print that they never think of
questioning copyright statements. Eleven hundred
and forty copies usually will delight them
almost beyond endurance. (Laughter and applause).
Go look at the book lists of the publishers
and you will feel the truth of what I have
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me ask you if you can give, or if
any publisher can give one solitary honest reason
why the publishing business should not be
put upon a cash basis&mdash;a manuscript for so much
money? The publisher controls his own business,
he knows every nook and corner, every
leaf and every line of it, and he should be able
to say, just as the corn-merchant does, I will
give you so much, to which the author would
say: I will take it, or I will not take it. But
what is the good of standing here and arguing?
You believe every word I speak, but you don&rsquo;t
expect to profit by it. You will go on gambling
at the publisher&rsquo;s faro table just as long as he
will smile and deal the cards. Some of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
days you will win, you think. Poor deluded
wretches, go on and die in the faith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had Ferris ended than Lucas the
historian arose and expressed grave doubts as
to the propriety of the address. He was decidedly
of the opinion that authors could not afford
to express themselves so freely and, if he must
say it, recklessly. How could Mr. Ferris substantiate
by proof any of the damaging allegations
he had made against publishers of high
standing? What Mr. Ferris had said might be
strictly true, but the facts were certainly, very
hard to come at, he thought. He hoped that
Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s address would not be reported to the
press (here he glanced appealingly at Miss
Crabb), at least not as the sense of the meeting.
Such a thing would, in his opinion, be liable to
work a great harm to all present. He felt sure
that the publishers would resent the whole
thing as malicious and libellous.</p>

<p>Throughout the audience there was a nervous
stirring, a looking at one another askance. It
was as if a cold wave had flowed over them.
Nobody had anything further to say, and it was
a great relief when Dufour moved an adjournment
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</i>, which was carried by a vote that
suggested a reserve of power. Every face in
the audience, with the exception of Dufour&rsquo;s,
wore a half-guilty look, and everybody crept
silently out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> caused quite a commotion on Mt. Boab
when Bartley Hubbard and Miss Henrietta
Stackpole, newspaper people from Boston,
arrived at Hotel Helicon. Miss Stackpole had
just returned from Europe, and Bartley Hubbard
had run down from Boston for a week to
get some points for his paper. She had met
Mr. Henry James on the continent and Hubbard
had dined with Mr. Howells just before leaving
Boston.</p>

<p>No two persons in all the world would have
been less welcome among the guests at the hotel,
just then, than were these professional reporters.
Of course everybody tried to give them a cordial
greeting, but they were classed along with Miss
Crabb as dangerous characters whom it would
be folly to snub. Miss Moyne was in downright
terror of them, associating the thought of
them with those ineffable pictures of herself
which were still appearing at second and third
hand in the &ldquo;patent insides&rdquo; of the country
journals, but she was very good to them, and
Miss Stackpole at once attached herself to her
unshakably. Hubbard did likewise with little
Mrs. Philpot, who amused him mightily with
her strictures upon analytical realism in fiction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do think that Mr. Howells treated you
most shamefully,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;He had
no right to represent you as a disagreeable person
who was cruel to his wife and who had no
moral stamina.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Hubbard laughed as one who hears an absurd
joke. &ldquo;Oh, Howells and I have an understanding.
We are really great friends,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
sat to him for my portrait and I really think he
flattered me. I managed to keep him from seeing
some of my ugliest lines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are not quite sincere,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Philpot, glancing over him from head to foot.
&ldquo;You are not so bad as he made you out to be.
It&rsquo;s one of Mr. Howells&rsquo;s hobbies to represent
men as rather flabby nonentities and women as
invalids or dolls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the men down fine,&rdquo; replied Hubbard,
&ldquo;but I guess he is rather light on women.
You will admit, however, that he dissects feminine
meanness and inconsequence with a deft
turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He makes fun of women,&rdquo; said Mrs. Philpot,
a little testily, &ldquo;he caricatures them, wreaks his
humor on them; but you know very well that
he misrepresents them even in his most serious
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</i> truthful moods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubbard laughed, and there was something
essentially vulgar in the notes of the laugh.
Mrs. Philpot admitted this mentally, and she
found herself shrinking from his steadfast but
almost conscienceless eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine I shouldn&rsquo;t be as bad a husband
as he did me into, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Philpot interrupted him with a start and
a little cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! and aren&rsquo;t you married?&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
asked in exclamatory deprecation of what his
words had implied.</p>

<p>He laughed again very coarsely and looked
at her with eyes that almost lured. &ldquo;Married!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, &ldquo;do I look like a marrying
man? A newspaper man can&rsquo;t afford to
marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; reflected Mrs. Philpot,
&ldquo;how funny, and Mr. Howells calls himself a
realist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Realist!&rdquo; laughed Hubbard, &ldquo;why he does
not know enough about the actual world to be
competent to purchase a family horse. He&rsquo;s a
capital fellow, good and true and kind-hearted,
but what does he know about affairs? He
doesn&rsquo;t even know how to flatter women!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; exclaimed little Mrs. Philpot,
but Hubbard could not be sure for the
life of him just what she meant the expression
to characterize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you like Mr. Howells?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like him! everybody likes him,&rdquo; he cordially
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are quite different from Miss
Crabb. <em>She</em> hates Maurice Thompson for putting
<em>her</em> into a story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Hubbard, indifferently,
&ldquo;women are not like men. They take life
more seriously. If Thompson had had more
experience he would not have tampered with a
newspaper woman. He&rsquo;s got the whole crew
down on him. Miss Stackpole hates him
almost as fiercely as she hates Henry James.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame her,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Philpot,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s mean and contemptible for men to caricature
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; yawned Hubbard, &ldquo;it
all goes in a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this opportune moment Miss Crabb and
Miss Stackpole joined them, coming arm in
arm. Miss Crabb looking all the more sallow
and slender in comparison with the plump,
well-fed appearance of her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I introduce you to Miss Crabb of the
Ringville <cite>Star</cite>, Mr. Hubbard,&rdquo; Miss Stackpole
asked, in a high but by no means rich voice, as
she fastened her steady, button-like eyes on
Mrs. Philpot.</p>

<p>Hubbard arose lazily and went through the
process of introduction perfunctorily, giving
Miss Crabb a sweeping but indifferent glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an impromptu pedestrian excursion
on hand,&rdquo; said Miss Stackpole, &ldquo;and I feel
bound to go. One of the gentlemen has discovered
a hermit&rsquo;s cabin down a ravine near here,
and he offers to personally conduct a party to
it. You will go, Mr. Hubbard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go! I should remark that I will. You
don&rsquo;t get a scoop of that item, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Stackpole was a plump and rather
pretty young woman, fairly well dressed in
drab drapery. She stood firmly on her feet and
had an air of self-reliance and self-control in
strong contrast with the fussy, nervous manner
of Miss Crabb.</p>

<p>Mrs. Philpot surveyed the two young women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with that comprehensive, critical glance which
takes in everything that is visible, and quickly
enough she made up her comparison and estimate
of them.</p>

<p>She decided that Miss Crabb had no style, no
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</i>, no repose; but then Miss Stackpole
was forward, almost impudent in appearance,
and her greater ease of manner was really the
ease that comes of a long training in intrusiveness,
and of rubbing against an older civilization.
She felt quite distinctly the decided dash
of vulgarity in the three newspaper representatives
before her, and she could not help suspecting
that it would not be safe to judge the
press reporters by these examples.</p>

<p>The question arose in her mind whether
after all Howells and Henry James and Maurice
Thompson had acted fairly in taking these as
representative newspaper people.</p>

<p>She had met a great many newspaper people
and had learned to like them as a class; she
had many good and helpful friends among
them.</p>

<p>Unconsciously she was showing to all present
that she was dissecting the three reporters. Her
unfavorable opinion of them slowly took expression
in her tell-tale face. Not that she wholly
disliked or distrusted them; she really pitied
them. How could they be content to live such
a life, dependent upon what they could make
by meddling, so to speak?</p>

<p>Then too, she felt a vague shame, a chagrin,
a regret that real people must be put into works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of fiction with all the seamy side of their natures
turned out to the world&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it,&rdquo; exclaimed Hubbard, &ldquo;Mrs.
Philpot is making a study of us as a group.
See the dreaming look in her eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! she never studies anybody or
anything,&rdquo; said Miss Crabb. &ldquo;Poor little woman,
real life is a constant puzzle to her, and she
makes not the slightest effort to understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubbard and Miss Stackpole glanced curiously
at each other and then at Miss Crabb.
Evidently their thought was a common one.</p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pedestrian excursion spoken of by Miss
Stackpole promised to be an enjoyable affair to
those of the Helicon guests who could venture
upon it. A writer of oddly entertaining and
preposterously impossible short stories, John B.
Cattleton, had been mousing among the ravines
of Mt. Boab, and had stumbled upon what he
described as a &ldquo;very obscure little cabin, jammed
under a cliff in an angle of the cañon and
right over a bright stream of cold, pure spring-water.
It&rsquo;s a miserably picturesque and forlornly
prepossessing place,&rdquo; he went on in his
droll way, &ldquo;where all sorts of engaging ghosts
and entertaining ogres might be supposed to
congregate at midnight. I didn&rsquo;t go quite
down to it, but I was near enough to it to
make out its main features, and I saw the
queerest being imaginable poking around the
premises. A veritable hermit, I should call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
him, as old as the rocks themselves. His dress
was absurdly old-fashioned, a caricature of the
uniform of our soldier sires of revolutionary
renown. A long spike-tailed blue coat with
notable brass buttons, a triangular hat somewhat
bell-crowned and tow or cotton trousers. Shirt?
Vest? Yes, if I remember well they were of
copperas homespun. His hair and beard were
white, fine and thin, hanging in tags and wisps as
fluffy as lint. I sat upon a rock in the shadow of
a cedar tree and watched his queer man&oelig;uvres for
a good while. All his movements were furtive
and peculiar, like those of a shy, wild beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Prophet of the Smoky Mountain,&rdquo;
said Miss Crabb in an earnest stage whisper.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Craddock&rsquo;s material, we can&rsquo;t touch
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch him! I&rsquo;ll interview him on dialect
in politics,&rdquo; said Hubbard, &ldquo;and get his views
on sex in genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like a sketch of his life. There
must be a human interest to serve as straw for
my brick,&rdquo; remarked Miss Stackpole. &ldquo;The
motive that induced him to become a hermit,
and all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Crabb dared not confess that she desired
a sketch of the old man for the newspaper syndicate,
so she merely drummed on her front
teeth with her pencil.</p>

<p>Dufour joined the pedestrian party with
great enthusiasm, having dressed himself for
the occasion in a pair of tennis trousers, a blue
flannel shirt, a loose jacket and a shooting cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>His shoes were genuine alpine foot-gear with
short spikes in their heels and soles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead on Cattleton,&rdquo; he cried jovially, &ldquo;and
let our motto be, &lsquo;On to the hut of Friar
Tuck&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; answered Cattleton in like spirit,
&ldquo;and you shall be my lieutenant, come, walk
beside me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,&rdquo;
replied Dufour, &ldquo;but I cannot accept. I have
contracted to be Miss Moyne&rsquo;s servant instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a gay procession filing away from
Hotel Helicon through the thin forest that
fringed one shoulder of stately Mt. Boab. Cattleton
led the column, flinging back from time
to time his odd sayings and preposterous conceits.</p>

<p>The day was delightfully cool with a steady
wind running over the mountain and eddying
in the sheltered coves where the ferns were
thick and tall. In the sky were a few pale
clouds slowly vanishing, whilst some broad-pinioned
buzzards wheeled round and round
above the blue-green abyss of the valley. There
were sounds of a vague, dreamy sort abroad in
the woods, like the whisperings and laughter of
legions of invisible beings. Everybody felt
exhilarated and buoyant, tramping gaily away
to the hut of the hermit.</p>

<p>At a certain point Cattleton commanded a
halt, and pointing out the entrance to the ravine,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, good friends, we must have perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
silence during the descent, or our visit will be
all in vain. Furthermore, the attraction of
gravitation demands that, in going down, we
must preserve our uprightness, else our progress
may be facilitated to an alarming degree,
and our advent at the hut be far from becomingly
dignified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like a snake, flecked with touches of gay
color, the procession crawled down the ravine,
the way becoming steeper and more tortuous
at every step. Thicker and thicker and thicker
grew the trees, saving where the rock broke
forth from the soil, and closer drew the zig-zags
of the barely possible route. Cattleton silenced
every voice and rebuked every person who
showed signs of weakening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a few steps farther,&rdquo; he whispered
back from his advanced position, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make
the least sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the ravine proved, upon this second
descent much more difficult and dangerous than
it had appeared to Cattleton at first, and it was
with the most heroic exertions that he finally
led the party down to the point whence he had
viewed the cabin. By this time the column
was pressing upon him and he could not stop.
Down he went, faster and faster, barely able to
keep his feet, now sliding, now clutching a tree
or rock, with the breathless and excited line of
followers gathering dangerous momentum behind
him.</p>

<p>It was too late now to command silence or to
control the company in any way. An avalanche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of little stones, loosened by scrambling
feet, swept past him and went leaping on down
below. He heard Miss Moyne utter a little
scream of terror that mingled with many exclamations
from both men and women, and then
he lost his feet and began to slide. Down he
sped and down sped the party after him, till in
a cataract of mightily frightened, but unharmed
men and women, they all went over a little
precipice and landed in a scattered heap on a
great bed of oak leaves that the winds had
drifted against the rock.</p>

<p>A few moments of strange silence followed,
then everybody sprang up, disheveled and red-faced,
to look around and see what was the
matter.</p>

<p>They found themselves close to the long, low
cabin, from under which flowed a stream of
water. A little column of smoke was wandering
out of a curious clay chimney. Beside the
low door-way stood a long, deep trough filled
with water in which a metal pipe was coiled
fantastically. Two earthen jugs with cob stoppers
sat hard by. A sourish smell assaulted
their sense and a faint spirituous flavor burdened
the air.</p>

<p>Cattleton, who was first upon his feet, shook
himself together and drolly remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have arrived in good order, let&rsquo;s interview
the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then rushed forth from the door the old
man of the place, who halted outside and
snatched from its rack on the wall a long tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
horn, which he proceeded to blow vigorously,
the echoes prowling through the woods and
over the foot-hills and scampering far away up
and down the valley.</p>

<p>Not a soul present ever could forget that
sketch, the old man with his shrunken legs
bent and wide apart, his arms akimbo as he
leaned far back and held up that wailing, howling,
bellowing horn, and his long coat-tail
almost touching the ground, whilst his fantastic
hat quivered in unison with the strain he was
blowing. How his shriveled cheeks puffed out,
and how his eyes appeared to be starting from
their bony sockets!</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I call a fitting reception,&rdquo;
said Cattleton, gazing at the trumpeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; exclaimed Crane with evident
excitement, &ldquo;I smell whisky! This&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hyer! what d&rsquo;ye mean hyer, you all a
comin&rsquo; down hyer?&rdquo; broke forth a wrathful voice,
and Wesley Tolliver rushed with melodramatic
fierceness upon the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&mdash;I&mdash;wa&mdash;want to g&mdash;go home!&rdquo; cried
little Mrs. Philpot, clutching Bartley Hubbard&rsquo;s
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said he with phlegmatic cleverness.
&ldquo;I should like to see my mother. I&rsquo;m
feeling a little lonely and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What upon yearth do this yer mean, anyhow?&rdquo;
thundered Tolliver. &ldquo;Who invited you
all down yer, tell me thet, will ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Tolliver, Mr. Tolliver!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Miss Crabb, rushing upon him excitedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
<em>so</em> glad you are here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll ber dorged!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;you
down hyer again! Well, I never seed the like
afore in all my born days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gazed at first one and then another of the
party, and a sudden light flashed into his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll ber dorged ef ther whole kepoodle
of &rsquo;em hain&rsquo;t done jest gone and tumbled off&rsquo;n
the mounting an&rsquo; jest rolled down hyer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very accurate reasoner, my friend,&rdquo;
said Cattleton, trying to get his hat into shape.
&ldquo;I think we touched at two or three points as
we came down, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About this time four or five more mountaineers
appeared bearing guns and looking savage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bandits,&rdquo; said Miss Stackpole with a shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moonshiners,&rdquo; muttered Crane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Hubbard, do
t&mdash;t&mdash;take m&mdash;me home!&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Philpot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be delighted,&rdquo; said Hubbard, his
voice concealing the uneasiness he felt. &ldquo;Indeed
I should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More men appeared and at the same time a
roll of thunder tumbled across the darkening
sky. A sudden mountain storm had arisen.</p>

<p>The pedestrians found themselves surrounded
by a line of grim and silent men who appeared
to be waiting for orders from Tolliver.</p>

<p>A few large drops of rain come slanting down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
from the advancing fringe of the sable-cloud,
and again the thunder bounded across the
heavens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d better invite us in,&rdquo; suggested
Cattleton, turning to the old man, who stood
leaning on his tin horn. &ldquo;The ladies will get
wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Cattleton,&rdquo; called out Bartley Hubbard,
&ldquo;if a fellow only had a little supply of
Stockton&rsquo;s negative gravity he could ameliorate
his condition, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to fall up hill just now. The
excitement would be refreshing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a spiteful dash of rain and a flurry
of wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ns had better go inter the still-house,&rdquo;
said Tolliver. &ldquo;Hit air goin&rsquo; ter rain yearlin&rsquo;
calves. Go right erlong in, ye sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another gush of rain enforced the invitation,
and they all scrambled into the cabin pell-mell,
glad of the relief from a strain that had become
almost unbearable to some of them, but they
stared at each other when they found the door
closed and securely locked on the outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prisoners!&rdquo; cried some one whose voice was
drowned by a deafening crash of thunder and a
mighty flood of rain that threatened to crush in
the rickety roof of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The treacherous villain!&rdquo; exclaimed Dufour,
speaking of Tolliver and holding Miss Moyne&rsquo;s
hand. The poor girl was so frightened that it
was a comfort to her to have her hand held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How grand, how noble it is in Mr. Tolliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and his friends,&rdquo; said Miss Crabb, &ldquo;to stand out
there in the rain and let us have the shelter! I
never saw a more virile and thoroughly unselfish
man than he is. He is one of Nature&rsquo;s unshorn
heroes, a man of the ancient god-like race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nancy Jones Black gave the young
woman a look of profound contempt.</p>

<p>Then a crash of thunder, wind, and rain scattered
everybody&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>


<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> storm was wild enough, but of short
duration, and it came to its end as suddenly as
it had begun. As the black cloud departed
from the sky, the darkness, which had been
almost a solid inside the still-house, was pierced
by certain lines of mild light coming through
various chinks in the walls and roof. Our
friends examined one another curiously, as if to
be sure that it was not all a dream.</p>

<p>Cattleton found himself face to face with a
demure-looking young man, whom he at once
recognized as Harry Punner, a writer of delicious
verses and editor of a rollicking humorous
journal at New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hal! you here?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Well
how does it strike your funny bone? It insists
upon appearing serious to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m smothering for a whiff of fresh air,&rdquo;
said Punner, in a very matter-of-fact tone.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we raise a window or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only window visible to the naked eye,&rdquo;
said Cattleton, &ldquo;is already raised higher than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
can reach,&rdquo; and he pointed to a square hole in
the wall about seven and a-half feet above the
ground and very near the roof.</p>

<p>Crane went about in the room remarking that
the aroma floating in the air was the bouquet
of the very purest and richest copper-distilled
corn whisky and that if he could find it he was
quite sure that a sip of it would prove very
refreshing under the peculiar circumstances of
the case, an observation which called forth from
Mrs. Nancy Jones Black a withering temperance
reprimand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the presiding officer of the <cite>Woman&rsquo;s
Prohibition Promulgation Society</cite> I cannot let
such a remark pass without condemning it. If
this really is a liquor establishment I desire to
be let out of it forthwith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; exclaimed little Mrs. Philpot
with great vehemence. &ldquo;Open the door Mr.
Hubbard, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubbard went to the door and finding that
it was constructed to open outwardly, gave it a
shove with all his might. There was a short
tussle and he staggered back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you push it open?&rdquo; fretfully
exclaimed Mrs. Nancy Jones Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentlemen outside object, for reasons
not stated,&rdquo; was the rather stolidly spoken
answer.</p>

<p>Cattleton had taken off his hat and was
going about through the company soliciting
handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop them in, drop them in,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;I
need all of them that I can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He offered his hat as a contribution box as
he spoke, and nearly every-one gave a handkerchief,
without in the least suspecting his purpose.</p>

<p>When he had collected a round dozen, Cattleton
crammed them all down in the crown of
his hat which he then put on his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Hal,&rdquo; he said, addressing Punner,
&ldquo;give me a boost and I&rsquo;ll make an observation
through that window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rain was now entirely ended and the wind
had fallen still.</p>

<p>With Punner&rsquo;s help Cattleton got up to the
window and poked out his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git back ther&rsquo;!&rdquo; growled a vicious voice,
and at the same time the dull sound of a heavy
blow was followed by the retreat of Cattleton
from the window to the floor in a great hurry.</p>

<p>Upon top of his hat was a deep trench made
by a club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The handkerchiefs did their duty nobly,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;Let everybody come forward
and identify his property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; asked Punner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A giant with an oak tree in his hand and
murder in his eye,&rdquo; said Cattleton, busily selecting
and returning the handkerchiefs. &ldquo;This
eleemosynary padding was all that saved me.
The blow was aimed at my divine intellect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; cried Peck, in great earnest,
&ldquo;this is no joking matter. We&rsquo;re in the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of a set of mountain moonshiners, and may be
murdered in cold blood. We&rsquo;d better do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crane had prowled around until he had found
a small jug of fragrant mountain dew whisky,
which he was proceeding to taste in true Kentucky
style, when a gaunt form rose in a corner
of the room, and tottering forward seized the jug
and took it out of his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No ye don&rsquo;t, sonny, no ye don&rsquo;t! This yer
mounting jew air not ever&rsquo;body&rsquo;s licker &rsquo;at
wants it. Not by er half er mile at the littlest
calc&rsquo;lation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Crabb made a note. Crane gazed pathetically
at the fantastic old man before him, and
brushed his handkerchief across his lips, as if
from habit, as he managed to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant no undue liberty, I assure you.
That whisky is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Overpowerin&rsquo;,&rdquo; interrupted the old man,
taking a sip from the vessel. &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t
blame ye fur a wantin&rsquo; of it, but this yer licker
air mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up in Kentucky,&rdquo; said Crane, &ldquo;we are proud
to offer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kaintucky! did ye say ole Kaintuck? Air
ye from ther&rsquo;, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The octogenarian leaned forward as he spoke
and gazed at Crane with steadfast, rheumy
eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Henrietta Stackpole came forward to
hear what was to follow, her instinct telling her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that a point of human interest was about to be
reached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Crane, &ldquo;I was born and reared
on Lulbegrud creek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lulbegrud!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fur f&rsquo;om Wright&rsquo;s mill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close by, at Kiddville,&rdquo; said Crane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye &rsquo;member Easton&rsquo;s Springs close by an&rsquo;
Pilot Knob away off in the distance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, indeed, and Guoff&rsquo;s pond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, what mought yer name be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll ber dorg!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man stood gazing and grinning at
Crane for some moments, and then added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer pap&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eliphas Crane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Liphas Crane yore pap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child, I air yer pap&rsquo;s uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I air Peter Job Crane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sartin es anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you my father&rsquo;s uncle Peter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I air yer pap&rsquo;s uncle Pete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Stackpole did not permit a word, a look,
or a shade of this interview to escape her. She
now turned to Bartley Hubbard and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We Americans are the victims of heterogeneous
consanguinity. Such an incident as
this could not happen in England. It will be a
long time before we can get rid of our ancestors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Hubbard, nonchalantly, &ldquo;Yer
pap&rsquo;s uncle certainly is a large factor in American
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many men did you see when you looked
out?&rdquo; Peck inquired, addressing Cattleton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw only one, but he was a monster,&rdquo; was
the ready reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use brooding over trying
to escape by force. We&rsquo;re utterly helpless,
and that jolt on my head has rendered me unfit
for diplomatic efforts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose they will do with
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t dare let us go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be afraid that we would report their
illicit distillery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The affair began to take on a very serious
and gloomy aspect, and the room was growing
oppressively hot, owing to the presence of a
a small but energetic furnace that glowed under
a sighing boiler. Outside, with the clearing sky
and refreshed air, there arose a clamor of bird-song
in the dripping trees. Under the floor the
spring-stream gurgled sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye &rsquo;member Abbott&rsquo;s still house on ole
Lulbegrud?&rdquo; said the old man, pursuing his
reminisences, after he had permitted his grand-nephew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to taste the &ldquo;mounting jew,&rdquo; &ldquo;an&rsquo; Dan
Rankin&rsquo;s ole bob-tail hoss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, indeed,&rdquo; responded Crane, &ldquo;and
Billy Pace&rsquo;s blackberry fields where I picked
berries in summer and chased rabbits in winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take er nother drop o&rsquo; the jyful juice, boy,
fur the mem&rsquo;ry o&rsquo; ole Kaintuck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! but isn&rsquo;t it incomparably awful?&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Nancy Jones Black, gazing in
horrified fascination upon the two Kentuckians,
as they bowed to each other and drank alternately
from the little jug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Characteristic Southern scene not used by
Craddock,&rdquo; murmured Miss Crabb, making a
whole page of a single note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t this yere liquor taste o&rsquo; one thing an&rsquo;
smell o&rsquo; another an&rsquo; jes&rsquo; kinder git ter the lowest
p&rsquo;int o&rsquo; yer appetite?&rdquo; continued Crane&rsquo;s
great uncle Peter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delicious beyond compare,&rdquo; responded the
young man, drinking again, &ldquo;it is nectar of the
gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nancy Jones Black groaned, but could
not withdraw her eyes from the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good deal like ole times down to Abbott&rsquo;s
still-house on Lulbegrud, boy,&rdquo; the old man
suggested, &ldquo;ye don&rsquo;t forgit erbout Dan Rankin&rsquo;s
mule a-kickin&rsquo; ole man Hornback&rsquo;s hat off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poet laughed retrospectively and mopped
his glowing face with his handkerchief. The
heat from the furnace and the stimulus of the
excellent beverage were causing him to feel the
need of fresh air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, everybody was beginning to pant.
Miss Moyne was so overcome with excitement
and with the heat of the place, that she was
ready to faint, when the door was flung open and
Tolliver appeared. A rush of sweet cool air,
flooding the room, revived her, just as she was
sinking into Dufour&rsquo;s arms.</p>


<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Authors</span> who have added the vice of elocution
to the weakness of dialect verse-making, are
often at a loss for a sympathetic audience.
Whilst it is true that literary people are apt to
bear with a good deal of patience the mutually
offered inflictions incident to meeting one
another, they draw the line at dialect recitations;
and, as a rule, stubbornly refuse to be
bored with a fantastic rendition of &ldquo;When
Johnny got spanked by a mule,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Livery-stable
Bob,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Samantha&rsquo;s Courtin&rsquo;,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Over
the Ridge to the Pest-house,&rdquo; no matter how
dear a friend may offer the scourge. Circumstances
alter cases, however, and although
neither Carleton, nor Riley, nor yet Burdette,
nor Bill Nye (those really irresistible and wholly
delightful humorists), had come to Hotel Helicon,
there was a certain relief for those of the
guests who had not joined the luckless pedestrians,
in hearing Miss Amelia Lotus Nebeker
recite a long poem written in New Jersey
patois.</p>

<p>Miss Nebeker was very hard of hearing,
almost stone deaf, indeed, which affliction lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a pathetic effect even to her humor. She was
rather stout, decidedly short, and had a way of
making wry faces with a view to adding comicality
to certain turns of her New Jersey
phraseology, and yet she was somewhat of a
bore at times. Possibly she wished to read too
often and sometimes upon very unsuitable occasions.
It was Mrs. Bridges who once said that,
if the minister at a funeral should ask some one
to say a few appropriate words, Miss Nebeker,
if present, would immediately clear her throat
and begin reciting &ldquo;A Jerseyman&rsquo;s Jewsharp.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And if she once got started you&rsquo;d never be
able to stop her, for she&rsquo;s as deaf as an adder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was during the rainstorm, while those of
the guests who had not gone to the hermit&rsquo;s
hut with Cattleton, were in the cool and spacious
parlor of the hotel, that something was
said about Charles Dickens reading from his
own works. Strangely enough, although the
remark was uttered in a low key and at some
distance from Miss Nebeker, she responded at
once with an offer to give them a new rendering
of <cite>The Jerseyman&rsquo;s Jewsharp</cite>. Lucas, the
historian, objected vigorously, but she insisted
upon interpreting his words and gestures as emphatic
applause of her proposition. She arose
while he was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh now, that&rsquo;s too much, we&rsquo;re tired of the
jangling of that old harp; give us a rest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This unexpected and surprising slang from so
grave and dignified a man set everybody to
laughing. Miss Nebeker bowed in smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
acknowledgement of what appeared to her to be
a flattering anticipation of her humor, and taking
her manuscript from some hiding-place in
her drapery, made a grimace and began to read.
Mrs. Philpot&rsquo;s cat, in the absence of its mistress,
had taken up with the elocutionist and now
came to rub and purr around her feet while she
recited. This was a small matter, but in school
or church or lecture-hall, small matters attract
attention. The fact that the cat now and again
mewed plaintively set some of the audience to
smiling and even to laughing.</p>

<p>Such apparent approval of her new rendition
thrilled Miss Nebeker to her heart&rsquo;s core. Her
voice deepened, her intonations caught the spirit
of her mood, and she read wildly well.</p>

<p>Every one who has even a smattering of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i> current in New Jersey, will understand
how effective it might be made in the larynx
of a cunning elocutionist; and then whoever has
had the delicious experience of hearing a genuine
Jerseyman play on the jewsharp will naturally
jump to a correct conclusion concerning
the pathos of the subject which Miss Nebeker
had in hand. She felt its influence and threw
all her power into it. Heavy as she was, she
arose on her tip-toes at the turning point of the
story and gesticulated vehemently.</p>

<p>The cat, taken by surprise, leaped aside a pace
or two and glared in a half-frightened way,
with each separate hair on its tail set stiffly.
Of course there was more laughter which the
reader took as applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A brace of cats!&rdquo; exclaimed the historian.
&ldquo;A brace of cats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody knew what he meant, but the laughing
increased, simply for the reason that there
was nothing to laugh at.</p>

<p>Discovering pretty soon that Miss Nebeker
really meant no harm by her man&oelig;uvres, the cat
went back to rub and purr at her feet. Then Miss
Nebeker let down her heel on the cat&rsquo;s tail, at
the same time beginning with the pathetic part
of <cite>The Jerseyman&rsquo;s Jewsharp</cite>.</p>

<p>The unearthly squall that poor puss gave forth
was wholly lost on the excited elocutionist, but
it quite upset the audience, who, not wishing
to appear rude, used their handkerchiefs freely.</p>

<p>Miss Nebeker paused to give full effect to a
touching line.</p>

<p>The cat writhed and rolled and clawed the air
and wailed like a lost spirit in its vain endeavor
to free its tail; but Miss Nebeker, all unconscious
of the situation, and seeing her hearers
convulsed and wiping tears from their faces,
redoubled her elocutionary artifices and poured
incomparable feeling into her voice.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tortured and writhing animal
uttered a scream of blood-curdling agony and
lunged at Miss Nebeker&rsquo;s ankles with tooth and
claw.</p>

<p>She was in the midst of the passage where
the dying Jerseyman lifts himself on his elbow
and calls for his trusty Jewsharp:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gi&rsquo; me my juice-harp, Sarah Ann&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she
was saying, when of a sudden she screamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
louder than the cat and bounded into the air,
sending her manuscript in fluttering leaves all
over the room.</p>

<p>The cat, with level tail and fiery eyes, sailed
through the door-way into the hall, and went as
if possessed of a devil, bounding up the stairway
to Mrs. Philpot&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>Congratulations were in order, and Lucas
insisted upon bellowing in Miss Nebeker&rsquo;s ear
his appreciation of the powerful effect produced
by the last scene in the little drama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If our friends who are out in this rain are
finding anything half as entertaining,&rdquo; he thundered,
&ldquo;they needn&rsquo;t mind the drenching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m bitten, I&rsquo;m scratched, I&rsquo;m hurt,&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Lucas suddenly realized the brutality of his
attitude, and hastened to rectify it by collecting
the leaves of her manuscript and handing them
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; he said sincerely, &ldquo;I hope
you are not hurt much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like a cat,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;always under
somebody&rsquo;s feet! I do despise them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a burning face and trembling hands
she swiftly rearranged the manuscript and
assuming the proper attitude asked the audience
to be seated again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am bitten and scratched quite severely,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and am suffering great pain, but if
you will resume your places I will begin over
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Call that cat back, then, quick!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lucas, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the star performer in the play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She proceeded forthwith, setting out on a new
journey through the tortuous ways of the poem,
and held up very well to the end. What she
called New Jersey patois was a trifle flat when
put into verse and she lacked the polished buffoonery
of a successful dialect reader, wherefore
she failed to get along very successfully with
her audience in the absence of the cat; still the
reading served to kill a good deal of time, by a
mangling process.</p>

<p>The storm was over long ago when she had
finished, and the sun was flooding the valley
with golden splendor. Along the far away
mountain ridges some slanting wisps of whitish
mist sailed slowly, like aerial yachts riding dark
blue billows. The foliage of the trees, lately
dusky and drooping, twinkled vividly with a
green that was almost dazzling, and the air was
deliciously fresh and fragrant.</p>

<p>Everybody went out on the veranda for a
turn and a deep breath.</p>

<p>The mail had arrived and by a mistake a
bundle of letters bearing the card of George
Dunkirk &amp; Co., and addressed to &ldquo;George Dunkirk,
Esq., Hotel Helicon, room 24,&rdquo; was handed
to Lucas.</p>

<p>The historian gazed at the superscription,
adjusted his glasses and gazed again, and slowly
the truth crept into his mind. There were ten
or fifteen of the letters. Evidently some of
them, as Lucas&rsquo;s experience suggested, had alien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
letters inclosed within their envelopes, and thus
forwarded by the mailing clerk of the firm had at
last come to the senior partner at room 24.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gaspard Dufour, indeed!&rdquo; Lucas exclaimed
inwardly. &ldquo;George Dunkirk, rather. This is
a pretty kettle of fish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sent the letters up to room 24, to await
the return of their proper recipient, and fell to
reflecting upon the many, very many and very
insulting things that he and nearly all the rest
of the hotel guests as well had said in Dufour&rsquo;s
hearing about publishers in general and about
George Dunkirk &amp; Co., in particular. His face
burned with the heat of the retrospect, as he
recalled such phrases as &ldquo;sleek thief,&rdquo; &ldquo;manipulator
of copy-right statements,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cadmean
wolf&rdquo; &ldquo;ghoul of literary grave-yards,&rdquo; and a
hundred others, applied with utter unrestraint
and bandied around, while George Dunkirk was
sitting by listening to it all!</p>

<p>He called Ferris to him and imparted his discovery
in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dickens!&rdquo; was all that gentleman
could say, as the full text of his address of the
other evening rushed upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is awkward, devilish awkward,&rdquo; remarked
Lucas, wiping his glasses and nervously readjusting
them.</p>

<p>A few minutes later two men rode up to the
hotel. One of them was a very quiet-looking
fellow who dryly stated that he was the high
sheriff of Mt. Boab county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> down the ravine in the obscure
little still-house our pedestrians were held in
durance vile by Tolliver and his obedient
moon-shiners.</p>

<p>It was a puzzling situation to all concerned.
Far from wishing or intending to harm his
prisoners, Tolliver still could not see his way
clear to setting them at liberty. On the other
hand he was clever enough to perceive that to
hold them very long would be sure to lead to
disaster, for their friends would institute a
search and at the same time telegraph an
account of their disappearance all over the
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears ter me like I&rsquo;ve ketched bigger game
&rsquo;an my trap&rsquo;ll hold,&rdquo; he thought, as he stood
in the door-way surveying his victims.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ye all a doin&rsquo; a monkeyin&rsquo; round&rsquo;
these yer premerses, anyhow?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;W&rsquo;y c&rsquo;udn&rsquo;t ye jest wait &rsquo;ll I sent for ye ter
kem yer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of surprise party, my dear sir,&rdquo;
said Cattleton. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;prise set o&rsquo; meddlin&rsquo; Yankees a foolin&rsquo;
roun&rsquo; wher&rsquo; they air not got no business at,&rdquo;
responded Tolliver, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s w&rsquo;at I calls it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your pantry?&rdquo; inquired Punner,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as hungry as a wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hongry, air ye? What&rsquo;d ye &rsquo;spect ter git
ter eat at er still-house, anyhow? Hain&rsquo;t ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
got no sense er tall? Air ye er plum blasted
eejit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tolliver made these inquiries in a voice and
manner suggestive of suppressed but utter wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;s <em>always</em> hungry, he would starve in
a feed-store,&rdquo; exclaimed Cattleton. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay
the least attention to him, Mr. Tolliver. He&rsquo;s incurably
hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y ef the man&rsquo;s really hongry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Tolliver
began to say in a sympathetic tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; interrupted Hubbard gruffly, &ldquo;let
us out of this immediately, can&rsquo;t you? The
ladies can&rsquo;t bear this foul air much longer, it&rsquo;s
beastly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe hit air you &rsquo;at air a running this yer
chebang,&rdquo; said Tolliver with a scowl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll jes&rsquo;
let ye out w&rsquo;en I git ready an&rsquo; not a minute
sooner, nother. So ye&rsquo;ve hearn my tin horn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Stackpole and Miss Crabb made notes in
amazing haste.</p>

<p>Hubbard shrugged his heavy shoulders and bit
his lip. He was baffled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll kill us?&rdquo; murmured Miss
Moyne in Dufour&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>Dufour could not answer.</p>

<p>Crane and his &ldquo;pap&rsquo;s uncle Pete&rdquo; were still
hobnobbing over the jug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer&rsquo;s a lookin&rsquo; at ye, boy, an&rsquo; a hopin&rsquo; agin
hope &rsquo;at ye may turn out ter be es likely a man
es yer pap,&rdquo; the old man was saying, preliminary
to another draught.</p>

<p>Crane was bowing with extreme politeness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
acknowledgement of the sentiment, and was
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am told that I look like my father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ye do look a leetle like im,&rdquo; interrupted
the old man with a leer over the jug,
&ldquo;but l&rsquo;me say at it air dern leetle, boy, dern
leetle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Punner overhearing this reply, laughed uproariously.
Crane appeared oblivious to the whole
force of the joke, however. He was simply
waiting for his turn at the jug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I wer&rsquo; a sayin&rsquo;,&rdquo; resumed the old man,
&ldquo;yer&rsquo;s er hopin&rsquo; agin&rsquo; hope, an&rsquo; a lookin&rsquo; at
ye&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How utterly brutal and disgusting!&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Nancy Jones Black. &ldquo;I must leave here, I
cannot bear it longer! This is nothing but a
low, vile dram-shop! Let me pass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She attempted to go through the doorway,
but Tolliver interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay wher&rsquo; ye air,&rdquo; he said, in a respectful
but very stern tone. &ldquo;Ye can&rsquo;t git out o&rsquo; yer
jist yit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! Dear me!&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Black,
&ldquo;what an outrage, what an insult! Are you
men?&rdquo; she cried, turning upon the gentlemen
near her, &ldquo;and will you brook this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me your handkerchiefs again,&rdquo; said
Cattleton, &ldquo;and I will once more poke out my
head; &rsquo;tis all that I can do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot the fust head &rsquo;at comes out&rsquo;n thet
ther winder, Dave!&rdquo; ordered Tolliver, speaking
to some one outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for any handkerchiefs, thank
you,&rdquo; said Cattleton, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Moyne was holding Dufour&rsquo;s arm with a
nervous clutch, her eyes were full of tears, and
she was trembling violently. He strove to quiet
her by telling her that there was no danger,
that he would shield her, die for her and all
that; but Tolliver looked so grim and the situation
was so strange and threatening that she
could not control herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! but isn&rsquo;t this rich material,&rdquo; Miss
Crabb soliloquized, writing in her little red
book with might and main. &ldquo;Bret Harte never
discovered anything better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Henrietta Stackpole was too busy
absorbing the human interest of the interview
between the two Cranes, to be more than indirectly
aware of anything else that was going on
around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye needn&rsquo;t be erfeard as ter bein&rsquo; hurt, boy,&rdquo;
said the old man, &ldquo;not es long es yer pap&rsquo;s
uncle Pete air eroun&rsquo; yer. Hit ain&rsquo;t often &rsquo;at I
meets up wi&rsquo; kinfolks downyer, an&rsquo; w&rsquo;en I does
meet up wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em I treats &rsquo;em es er Southern
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;man orter treat his kinfolks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely so,&rdquo; said Crane, taking another
sip, &ldquo;hospitality is a crowning Southern virtue.
When I go up to Louisville Henry Watterson
and I always have a good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spect ye do, boy, spect ye do. Louisville
use ter be a roarin&rsquo; good place ter be at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tolliver, whose wits had been hard at work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
now proposed what he called &ldquo;terms o&rsquo; pay-roll,
like what they hed in the war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ef ye&rsquo;ll all take a oath an&rsquo; swa&rsquo; at ye&rsquo;ll
never tell nothin&rsquo; erbout nothin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;w&rsquo;y
I&rsquo;ll jest let ye off this yer time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is fair enough,&rdquo; said Dufour, &ldquo;we are
not in the detective service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; observed Tolliver, &ldquo;ef I ken git the
&rsquo;tention of this yer meetin&rsquo;, I move &rsquo;at it air
yerby considered swore &rsquo;at nothin&rsquo; air ter be
said erbout nothin&rsquo; at no time an&rsquo; never. Do ye
all swa&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; rang out a chorus of voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit air cyarried,&rdquo; said Tolliver, &ldquo;an&rsquo; the
meetin&rsquo; air dismissed, sigh er die. Ye kin all
go on erbout yer business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pedestrians filed out into the open air
feeling greatly relieved. Crane lingered to have
a few more passages with his sociable and hospitable
grand-uncle. Indeed he remained until
the rest of the party had passed out of sight up
the ravine and he did not reach the hotel until
far in the night, when he sang some songs under
Miss Moyne&rsquo;s window.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, the pedestrians felt that
they had been quite successful in their excursion.</p>

<p>Dufour was happiness itself. On the way
back he had chosen for himself and Miss Moyne
a path which separated them from the others,
giving him an opportunity to say a great deal
to her.</p>

<p>Now it is a part of our common stock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
understanding that when a man has an excellent
and uninterrupted opportunity to say a
great deal to a beautiful young woman, he usually
does not find himself able to say much;
still he rarely fails to make himself understood.</p>

<p>They both looked so self-consciously happy
(when they arrived a little later than the rest
at Hotel Helicon) that suspicion would have
been aroused but for two startling and all-absorbing
disclosures which drove away every
other thought.</p>

<p>One was the disclosure of the fact that Dufour
was not Dufour, but George Dunkirk, and
the other was the disclosure of the fact that the
high sheriff of Mt. Boab County was in Hotel
Helicon on important official business.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Philpot was the first to discover
that the great publisher really had not practiced
any deception as to his name. Indeed her
album showed that the signature therein was,
after all, George Dunkirk and not Gaspard
Dufour. The autograph was not very plain, it
is true, but it was decipherable and the mistake
was due to her own bad reading.</p>

<p>If the sheriff had been out of the question the
humiliation felt by the authors, for whom Dunkirk
was publisher and who had talked so outrageously
about him, would have crushed them
into the dust; but the sheriff was there in his
most terrible form, and he forced himself upon
their consideration with his quiet but effective
methods of legal procedure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>


<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gaslucky</span> has been caught in a wheat corner
at Chicago,&rdquo; Lucas explained, &ldquo;and has
been squeezed to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; cried Punner, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a great loss.
We&rsquo;ll have to hold a meeting and pass
res&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get out of this place in short
order,&rdquo; said Lucas, &ldquo;the sheriff has levied an
attachment on the hotel and all it contains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that the house is to be shut
up and we turned out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said Lucas. &ldquo;The sheriff has
invoiced every thing, even the provisions on
hand. He says that we can&rsquo;t eat another bite
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m starving even now!&rdquo; exclaimed
Punner. &ldquo;I could eat most anything. Let&rsquo;s
walk round to Delmonico&rsquo;s, Cattleton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But really, what can we do?&rdquo; demanded
Ferris, dolefully enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home, of course,&rdquo; said Cattleton.</p>

<p>Ferris looked blank and stood with his hands
thrust in his pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go home,&rdquo; he presently remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t money enough to pay my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George! neither have I!&rdquo; exclaimed
Cattleton with a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is precisely my fix,&rdquo; said Lucas
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You echo my predicament,&rdquo; said Peck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My salary is suspended during my absence,&rdquo;
said Punner, with his eyes bent on the floor.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Philpot was speechless for a time
as the force of the situation broke upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Squeezed in a wheat corner?&rdquo; inquired
Miss Stackpole, &ldquo;what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that Gaslucky got sheared in the
big deal the other day at Chicago,&rdquo; Lucas
explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got sheared?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the bulls sat down on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean a speculation&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Gaslucky was in for all he was worth,
and they run it down on him and flattened him.
A gas-man&rsquo;s no business in wheat, especially in
Chicago; they spread him out, just as the
sheriffs proceedings have flattened all our
hopes for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just outrageous!&rdquo; cried little Mrs. Philpot,
finding her voice. &ldquo;He should have notified
us, so that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t notify him, I guess,&rdquo; said Cattleton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he found it out afterwards,&rdquo; remarked
Lucas, glancing gloomily toward where Dunkirk
and Miss Moyne stood, apparently in light
and pleasant conversation.</p>

<p>Viewed in any light the predicament was a
peculiar and distressing one to the guests of
Hotel Helicon. The sheriff, a rather ignorant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
but very stubborn and determined man, held
executions and writs of attachment sued out by
Gaslucky creditors, which he had proceeded to
levy on the hotel and on all the personalty
visible in it belonging to the proprietor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;hit&rsquo;ll be poorty hard on
you&rsquo;ns, but I can&rsquo;t help it, I&rsquo;ve got ter do my
juty, let it hurt whoever it will. Not er thing
kin ye tech at&rsquo;s in this yer tavern, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s your&rsquo;n, that air&rsquo;s jest how it air. So
now mind w&rsquo;at yer a doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants were idle, the dining-room closed,
the kitchen and pantries locked up. Never was
there a more doleful set of people. Mrs. Nancy
Jones Black thought of playing a piece of sacred
music, but she found the grand piano locked,
with its key deep in the sheriff&rsquo;s pocket.</p>

<p>The situation was made doubly disagreeable
when at last the officer informed the guests that
they would have to vacate their rooms forthwith,
as he should proceed at once to close up
the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens, man, are you going to turn us out
into the woods?&rdquo; demanded Peck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woods er no woods,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll hev
ter git out&rsquo;n yer, right off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the ladies, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo; suggested Punner,
&ldquo;no Southern gentleman can turn a lady
out of doors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer actually colored with the force of
the insinuation. He stood silent for some time
with his eyes fixed on the floor. Presently he
looked up and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The weeming kin stay till mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well they must have something to eat,&rdquo;
said Punner. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t starve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the sheriff admitted, &ldquo;they kin
hev a bite er so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You men folks cayn&rsquo;t hev a dorg gone mouthful,
so shet up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Cattleton, dryly, &ldquo;it appears
the odds is the difference between falling into
the hands of moonshiners and coming under the
influence of a lawful sheriff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a little law,&rdquo; interposed Bartley
Hubbard with a sullen emphasis, &ldquo;and I know
that this sheriff has no right to tumble us out
of doors, and for my part&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fur yer part,&rdquo; said the sheriff coolly, &ldquo;fur
yer part, Mister, ef ye fool erlong o&rsquo; me I&rsquo;ll
crack yer gourd fur ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stave in yer piggin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, blame yer ignorant hide, wha&rsquo; wer&rsquo; ye
borned and fotch up? I&rsquo;ll jest knock the everlastin&rsquo;
head off&rsquo;n ye, <em>thet&rsquo;s</em> &rsquo;zac&rsquo;ly w&rsquo;at I says.
Mebbe ye don&rsquo;t understan&rsquo; <em>thet</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hubbard, visibly shrinking into
himself, &ldquo;I begin to suspect your meaning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Crabb was taking notes with enthusiastic
rapidity.</p>

<p>Dunkirk called the sheriff to him and a long
conference was held between them, the result
of which was presently announced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I heve thort it over,&rdquo; said the quiet officer
of the law, &ldquo;an&rsquo; es hit appear thet w&rsquo;at grub air
on han&rsquo; an&rsquo; done cooked might spile afore it
c&rsquo;u&rsquo;d be sold, therefore I proclamate an&rsquo; say at
you&rsquo;ns kin stay yer tell termorrer an&rsquo; eat w&rsquo;at&rsquo;s
cooked, but tech nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cattleton and Punner applauded loudly. To
everybody the announcement was a reprieve of
no small moment, and a sigh of relief rustled
through the groups of troubled guests. Those
who had been down the ravine were very tired
and hungry; the thought of a cold luncheon to
them was the vision of a feast.</p>

<p>Dunkirk had a basket of wine brought down
from his room and he made the sheriff sit
beside him at the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may as well make the most of our last
evening together,&rdquo; he said, glancing jovially
around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have to walk down the mountain
in the morning, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked Bartley
Hubbard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest w&rsquo;at&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; observed the
sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the ladies, my dear sir, the ladies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began Punner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weeming, they&rsquo;ll hev kinveyances,
young man, so ye kin jest shet up ef ye please,&rdquo;
the officer interrupted, with a good-natured wink
and a knowing wag of his head.</p>

<p>A disinterested observer would have noted
readily enough that the feast was far from a
banquet. There was Ferris, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
munching a biscuit and sipping his wine and
pretending to enjoy Punner&rsquo;s sallies and Cattleton&rsquo;s
drolleries, while down in his heart lay the
leaden thought, the hideous knowledge of an
empty pocket. Indeed the reflection was a
common one, weighting down almost every
breast at the board.</p>

<p>One little incident did make even Ferris forget
himself for a moment or two, it was when
deaf Miss Nebeker misinterpreted some remark
made by Hubbard and arose with a view to
reciting <cite>The Jerseyman&rsquo;s Jewsharp</cite>, with a new
variation, &ldquo;Oh, Jerseyman Joe had a Jewsharp
of gold,&rdquo; she began, in her most melodious
drawl. She could not hear the protesting
voices of her friends and she misinterpreted the
stare of the sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the good heaven&rsquo;s sake, Hubbard,&rdquo;
cried Lucas, &ldquo;do use your influence; quick,
please, or I shall collapse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bartley Hubbard took hold of her dress and
gently pulled her down into her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sheriff objects!&rdquo; he yelled in her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After dinner?&rdquo; she resignedly inquired,
&ldquo;well, then after dinner, in the parlor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the feast had come to the crumbs,
Dunkirk arose and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all have had a good time at the Hotel
Helicon, but our sojourn upon the heights of
Mt. Boab has been cut short by a certain chain
of mishaps over which we have had no control,
and to-morrow we go away, doubtless forever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
I feel like saying that I harbor no unpleasant
recollections of the days we have spent together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cattleton sprung to his feet to move a vote
of thanks &ldquo;to the public-spirited and benevolent
man who built this magnificent hotel and threw
open its doors to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was carried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Lucas, adjusting his glasses
and speaking in his gravest chest-tones, &ldquo;I move
that it be taken as the sense of this assembly,
that it is our duty to draw upon our publisher
for money enough to take us home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The response was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Dunkirk felt the true state of affairs. He
arose, his broad face wreathed with genial
smiles, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the certain knowledge of your unhappy
publisher your accounts are already overdrawn,
but in view of the rich material you have been
gathering of late, your publisher will honor
you draughts to the limit of your expenses
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never did happier people go to bed. The
last sleep in Hotel Helicon proved to be the
sweetest.</p>

<p>Far in the night, it is true, some one sang
loudly but plaintively under Miss Moyne&rsquo;s
window until the sheriff awoke and sallied forth
to end the serenade with some remarks about
&ldquo;cracking that eejit&rsquo;s gourd;&rdquo; but there was no
disturbance, the sounds blending sweetly with
the dreams of the slumberers. They all knew
that it was Crane, poor fellow, who had finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
torn himself away from his father&rsquo;s fascinating
uncle.</p>


<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> retreat from Hotel Helicon was picturesque
in the extreme. There had been much
difficulty in finding vehicles to take the retiring
guests down the mountain to the railway station,
but Tolliver had come to the rescue with a
mule, a horse, a cart, and an ox. These, when
added to the rather incongruous collection of
wagons and carts from every other available
source, barely sufficed. Tolliver led the mule
with Ferris on its back, while Miss Crabb and
Miss Stackpole occupied the ox-cart, the former
acting as driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye and good luck to ye!&rdquo; the sheriff
called after them. &ldquo;Mighty sorry ter discommode
ye, but juty air juty, an&rsquo; a officer air no
respecter of persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nancy Jones Black sat beside Crane in a
rickety wagon, and between jolts gave him
many a word of wisdom on the subject of strong
drink, which the handsome Bourbon poet stowed
away for future consideration.</p>

<p>Dunkirk and Miss Moyne rode upon the
&ldquo;hounds&rdquo; of a naked wood-wain, as happy as
two blue-birds in April, while Bartley Hubbard,
with little Mrs. Philpot and her child and some
other ladies, was in an old weather-beaten
barouche, a sad relic of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante-bellum</i> times.
For the rest there were vehicles of every sort
save the comfortable sort, and all went slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
winding and zig-zagging down Mt. Boab toward
the valley and the river. Why pursue them?
Once they all looked up from far down the slope
and saw Hotel Helicon shining like a castle of
gold in the flood of summer sunlight. Its
verandas were empty, its windows closed, but
the flag on its wooden tower still floated bravely
in the breeze, its folds appearing to touch the
soft gray-blue sky.</p>

<p class="ast">*******</p>

<p>A year later Crane and Peck met at Saratoga
and talked over old times. At length coming
down to the present, Crane said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all of us who were guests on Mt. Boab,
Miss Moyne is the only one who has found
success. Her story, <cite>On The Heights</cite>, is in its
seventieth edition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Peck, &ldquo;that goes without
the saying. Anybody could succeed with her
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Her</em> chance, why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard? Ah, I see that the
news has not yet penetrated the wilds of Kentucky.
The open secret of Miss Moyne&rsquo;s success
lies in the fact that she has married her
publisher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence of some minutes followed, during
which Crane burned his cigar very rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fools we were,&rdquo; Peck presently ventured,
&ldquo;to be fighting a duel about her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Crane, with a far-away look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in his eyes, &ldquo;no, sir, I would die for her right
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the subject was dropped between them
forever.</p>

<p>Some of Gaslucky&rsquo;s creditors bought Hotel
Helicon at the sheriff&rsquo;s sale, but it proved a barren
investment.</p>

<p>The house stands there now, weather-beaten
and lonely on the peak of Mt. Boab, all tenantless
and forlorn.</p>

<p>As to Tolliver&rsquo;s still-house I cannot say, but
at stated intervals Crane receives a small cask
marked: &ldquo;J&rsquo;yful juice, hannel with keer,&rdquo;
which comes from his &ldquo;Pap&rsquo;s uncle Pete.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> you pass the &ldquo;Blue Anchor&rdquo;&mdash;the sign of
which swings from the branch of an elm tree older
even than the house itself&mdash;a few steps along the road
bring you in sight of the pinnacled, square tower of
Coombe-Acton Church. You cannot see the church
itself, as, with schools and rectory close by it, it lies at the
back of the village, about two hundred yards up a lane.
Like the village to whose spiritual needs it ministers,
the church, to an ordinary observer, is nothing out of
the common, although certain small peculiarities of
architecture, not noticed by an uncultured eye, make
it an object of some interest to archæologists. Visit it
or not, according to your inclination, but afterwards
keep on straight through the long, straggling village,
until the houses begin to grow even more straggling,
the gardens larger and less cared for as ornaments, displaying
more cabbages and scarlet runners than roses&mdash;keep
on until the houses cease altogether and hawthorn
hedges take the place of palings and crumbling
walls, and at last you will come to Watercress Farm, a
long, low white house, one side of which abuts on the
highway, whilst the other looks over the three hundred
acres of land attached to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a very large acreage, it is true, but then it is all
good land, for the most part such as auctioneers
describe as rich, warm, deep, old pasture land; such
land that, at the time this tale opens, any farmer, by
thrift, knowledge of his business, and hard work, could
make even more than a bare living out of, and could
meet his landlord on rent day with a cheerful face,
knowing that after rent and other outgoings were
provided for something would yet be left for himself.</p>

<p>Who occupies the Watercress Farm now, and
whether in these days of depression his rent is forthcoming
or not, matters little. At the time I write of it,
it was rented by farmer Leigh, even as his forefathers,
according to village tradition, had rented it for some
two hundred years. In quiet, conservative places like
Coombe-Acton, a farm of this kind often goes from
father to son with more regularity than an entailed
estate, landlord and tenant well knowing that their
interests are identical.</p>

<p>It was a fine afternoon towards the end of June.
Abraham Leigh was standing by the gate of the field
known as the home meadow looking at the long, ripe
grass rippling as the summer breeze swept across it.
He was a thoroughly good specimen of the Somersetshire
farmer. A big, sturdy man, whose movements
were slow and deliberate. His face, if heavy and
stolid, not by any means the face of a fool. No doubt,
a man of circumscribed views&mdash;the world, for him,
extending eastwards to Bristol market and westwards
to the Bristol Channel. Nevertheless, respected in his
little world as a wonderful judge of a beast, a great
authority on tillages, and, above all, a man who always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
had a balance in his favor at the Somersetshire Bank;
a type of that extinct race, the prosperous farmer, who
looked on all townsmen with contempt, thinking, as all
farmers should think, that the owners of broad acres,
and those engaged in agriculture were alone worthy
of respect.</p>

<p>Yet, to-day, in spite of his advantages and acquirements,
Farmer Leigh looked on the fifteen-acre meadow
with a puzzled and discontented expression on his
honest face; and, moreover, murmurs of dissatisfaction
were proceeding from his lips. Farmers&mdash;Somersetshire
farmers especially&mdash;are proverbial grumblers,
but it is seldom they grumble without an audience.
It is outsiders who get the benefit of their complaints.
Besides, one would think that the tenant of Watercress
Farm had little at present to complain of. The drop
of rain so badly wanted had been long in coming, but
it had come just in the nick of time to save the grass,
and if the crop outwardly looked a little thin, Mr.
Leigh&rsquo;s experienced eye told him that the undergrowth
was thick, and that the quality of the hay would be
first-class. Moreover, what corn and roots he had
looked promising, so it seems strange that the farmer
should be grumbling when he had no one to listen to
him, and should lean so disconsolately upon the gate of
the field when no one observed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make him out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good boy he
be, too; yet, instead o&rsquo; helping me with the land,
always going about dreaming or messing with mud.
Can&rsquo;t think where he got his notions from. Suppose
it must &rsquo;a been from the mother, poor thing! Always
fond o&rsquo; gimcracks and such like, she were. Gave the
lad such an outlandish name I&rsquo;m ashamed to hear it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Father&rsquo;s and grandfather&rsquo;s name ought to be good
enough for a Leigh&mdash;good boy though he be, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A soft look settled on Abraham Leigh&rsquo;s face as he
repeated the last words; then he went deeper into his
slough of despond, where, no doubt, he battled as manfully
as a Christian until he reached the other shore
and fancied he had found the solution of his difficulties.</p>

<p>His face brightened. &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;ee what,&rdquo; he said,
addressing the waving grass in front of him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask
Mr. Herbert. Squire&rsquo;s a man who have seen the
world. I&rsquo;ll take his advice about the boy. Seems
hard like on me, too. Ne&rsquo;er a Leigh till this one but
what were a farmer to the backbone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mind made up, the farmer strode off to make
arrangement with mowers. Had he been troubled
with twenty unnatural and incompetent sons, the hay
must be made while the sun shines.</p>

<p>Although he had settled what to do, it was some time
before the weighty resolve was carried into execution.
Folks about Coombe-Acton do not move with the celerity
of cotton brokers or other men of business. Sure
they are, but slow. So it was not until the September
rent day that the farmer consulted his landlord about
his domestic difficulty&mdash;the possession of a son, an only
child, of about fifteen, who, instead of making himself
useful on the land, did little else save wander about in
a dreamy way, looking at all objects in nature, animate
or inanimate, or employed himself in the mysterious
pursuit which his father described as &ldquo;messing with
mud.&rdquo; Such conduct was a departure from the respectable
bucolic traditions of the Leigh family, so
great, that at times the father thought it an infliction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
laid upon him for some cause or other by an inscrutable
Providence.</p>

<p>There are certain Spanish noblemen who, on account
of the antiquity of their families and services rendered,
are permitted to enter the royal presence with covered
heads. It was, perhaps, for somewhat similar reasons,
a custom handed down from father to son and established
by time, that the tenant of Watercress Farm
paid his rent to the landlord in person, not through the
medium of an agent. Mr. Herbert being an important
man in the West country, the Leigh family valued this
privilege as highly as ever hidalgo valued the one above
mentioned. Mr. Herbert, a refined, intellectual-looking
man of about fifty, received the farmer kindly, and after
the rent, without a word as to abatement or reduction,
had been paid in notes of the county bank&mdash;dark and
greasy, but valued in this particular district far above
Bank of England promises&mdash;landlord and tenant settled
down to a few minutes&rsquo; conversation on crops and kindred
subjects. Then the farmer unburdened his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask a favor of your advice, sir, about
my boy, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Herbert, &ldquo;I know him&mdash;a nice,
good-looking boy. I see him at church with you, and
about your place when I pass. What of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you zee, zur,&rdquo; said the farmer, speaking with
more Somerset dialect than usual, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ve a been at
Bristol Grammar School till just now. Masters all
send good accounts of him. I don&rsquo;t hold wi&rsquo; too
much learning, so thought &rsquo;twere time he come home
and helped me like. But not a bit o&rsquo; good he be on
the varm; not a bit, zur! Spends near all his time
messing about wi&rsquo; dirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo; asked Mr. Herbert, astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-muddling and a-messing with bits o&rsquo; clay. Making
little figgers, like, and tries to bake &rsquo;em in the
oven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see what you mean. What sort of figures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All sorts, sir. Little clay figgers of horses, dogs,
pigs&mdash;why, you&rsquo;d scarce believe it, sir&mdash;last week I
found him making the figger of a naked &rsquo;ooman! A
naked &rsquo;ooman! Why, the lad could never a&rsquo; seen such
a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abraham Leigh waited with open eyes to hear Mr.
Herbert&rsquo;s opinion of such an extraordinary, if not positively
unusual, proceeding.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert smiled. &ldquo;Perhaps your son is a youthful
genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genius or not, I want to know, sir, what to do wi&rsquo;
him. How&rsquo;s the boy to make a living? A farmer
he&rsquo;ll never be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You follow me and I will show you something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert led his guest to his drawing-room&mdash;a
room furnished with the taste of a travelled man. As
the farmer gaped at its splendor, he directed his attention
to four beautiful statues standing in the corners
of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave the man who made those seven hundred
pounds for them, and could sell them to-morrow for a
thousand if I chose. That&rsquo;s almost as good as farming,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tenant&rsquo;s eyes were wide with amazement. &ldquo;A
thousand pounds, sir!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Why, you might
have bought that fourteen-acre field with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These give me more pleasure than land,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Herbert. &ldquo;But about your boy; when I am riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
by I will look in and see what he can do, then
give you my advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmer thanked him and returned home. As
he jogged along the road to Watercress Farm, he muttered
at intervals: &ldquo;A thousand pounds in those white
figures! Well, well, well, I never did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert was a man who kept a promise, whether
made to high or low. Five days after his interview
with Abraham Leigh he rode up to the door of the
farm. He was not alone. By his side rode a gay,
laughing, light-haired child of thirteen, who ruled an
indulgent father with a rod of iron. Mr. Herbert had
been a widower for some years; the girl, and a boy
who was just leaving Harrow for the university, being
his only surviving children. The boy was, perhaps,
all that Mr. Herbert might have wished, but he could
see no fault in the precocious, imperious, spoilt little
maid, who was the sunshine of his life.</p>

<p>She tripped lightly after her father into the farm-house,
laughing at the way in which he was obliged to
bend his head to avoid damage from the low doorway;
she seated herself with becoming dignity on the chair
which the widowed sister, who kept house for Abraham
Leigh, tendered her with many courtesies. A
pretty child, indeed, and one who gave rare promise of
growing into a lovely woman.</p>

<p>The farmer was away somewhere on the farm, but
could be fetched in a minute if Mr. Herbert would
wait. Mr. Herbert waited, and very soon his tenant
made his appearance and thanked his visitor for the
trouble he was taking on his behalf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me see the boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Herbert, after
disclaiming all sense of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Leigh went to the door of the room and shouted
out, &ldquo;Jerry, Jerry, come down. You&rsquo;re wanted, my
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment the door opened, and the cause of Mr.
Leigh&rsquo;s discontent came upon the scene in the form of
a dark-eyed, dark-haired, pale-faced boy, tall but slightly
built; not, so far as physique went, much credit to
the country-side. Yet in some respects a striking-looking
if not handsome lad. The dark, eloquent eyes
and strongly-marked brow would arrest attention; but
the face was too thin, too thoughtful for the age, and
could scarcely be associated with what commonly constitutes
a good-looking lad. Yet regularity of feature
was there, and no one would dare to be sure that
beauty would not come with manhood.</p>

<p>He was not seen at that moment under advantageous
circumstances. Knowing nothing about the distinguished
visitors, he had obeyed his father&rsquo;s summons
in hot haste; consequently he entered the room in his
shirt sleeves, which were certainly not very clean, and
with hands covered with red clay. Mr. Herbert
looked amused, while the little princess turned up her
nose in great disdain.</p>

<p>Poor Abraham Leigh was much mortified at the
unpresentable state in which his son showed himself.
To make matters worse, the boy was not soiled by
honest, legitimate toil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut!&rdquo; he said, crossly. &ldquo;All of a muck, as
usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy, who felt that his father had a right to complain,
hung his head and showed signs of retreating.
Mr. Herbert came to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, patting young Leigh on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
shoulder, &ldquo;he has been working in his own fashion.
I have come on purpose to see those modellings of
yours, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy started as one surprised. His cheek
flushed, and he looked at the speaker with incredulity
yet hope in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his father, sharply. &ldquo;Go and put
your hands under the pump, Jerry; then bring some
of &rsquo;em down. Maybe, anyway, they&rsquo;ll amuse the little
lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Herbert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you
and see them for myself. Lead the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Leigh did not speak, but his eyes thanked
Mr. Herbert. That gentleman followed him from the
room, leaving the farmer to amuse the little maid.
He did this so far as he was able by producing a well-thumbed
copy of the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; the leaves
of which Miss Herbert condescended to turn daintily
over until she was quite terrified by the picture of the
combat with Apollyon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; with a beating heart, led Mr.
Herbert up-stairs to a room destitute of furniture save
an old table and chair. A bucket half-full of common
red clay stood in one corner, and on the table were
several of the little clay figures which had excited the
farmer&rsquo;s ire and consternation.</p>

<p>Crude, defective, full of faults as they were, there
was enough power in them to make Mr. Herbert look
at the lad in wonderment, almost envy. He was a
man who worshipped art; who had dabbled as an
amateur in painting and sculpturing for years; who
considered a gifted artist the most fortunate of mankind.
So the word envy is not ill-chosen. What he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
would have given half his wealth to possess came to
this boy unsought for&mdash;to the son of a clod of a farmer
the precious gift was vouchsafed!</p>

<p>As he would have expected, the most ambitious efforts
were the worst&mdash;the &ldquo;naked &rsquo;ooman&rdquo; was particularly
atrocious&mdash;but, still wet, and not ruined by
an abortive attempt at baking, was a group modelled
from life; a vulgar subject, representing, as it did,
Abraham Leigh&rsquo;s prize sow, surrounded by her ten
greedy offspring. There was such power and talent
in this production that, had he seen nothing else, Mr.
Herbert would have been certain that the lad as a
modeller and copyist must take the first rank. If, in
addition to his manual dexterity, he had poetry, feeling,
and imagination, it might well be that one of the
greatest sculptors of the nineteenth century stood in
embryo before him.</p>

<p>As Mr. Herbert glanced from the rough clay sketches
to the pale boy who stood breathless, as one expecting
a verdict of life or death, he wondered what could have
been the cause of such a divergence from the traits
habitual to the Leighs. Then he remembered that
some twenty years ago Abraham Leigh had chosen for
a wife, not one of his own kind, but a dweller in cities&mdash;a
governess, who exchanged, no doubt, a life of penury
and servitude for the rough but comfortable home
the Somersetshire farmer was willing to give her. Mr.
Herbert remembered her; remembered how utterly out
of place the delicate, refined woman seemed to be as
Leigh&rsquo;s wife; remembered how, a few years after the
birth of the boy, she sickened and died. It was from
the mother&rsquo;s side the artistic taste came.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert, although a kind man, was cautious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
He had no intention of raising hopes which might be
futile. Yet he felt a word of encouragement was due
to the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of these figures show decided talent,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;After seeing them, I need scarcely ask you if
you wish to be a sculptor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Leigh clasped his hands together. &ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo;
he gasped. &ldquo;If it could only be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not care to be a farmer, like your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could never be a farmer, sir. I am not fit for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, if you follow in your father&rsquo;s track, you will
lead a comfortable, useful life. If you follow art, you
may go through years of poverty and suffering before
success is attained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy raised his head and looked full at the
speaker; there was almost passionate entreaty in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you would only persuade my
father to let me try&mdash;even for a few years. If I did
not succeed I would come back to him and work as a
laborer for the rest of my life without a murmur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert was impressed by the boy&rsquo;s earnestness.
&ldquo;I will speak to your father,&rdquo; he said. Then the two
went back to the sitting-room, where they found Abraham
Leigh much exercised by some difficult questions
propounded by Miss Herbert respecting the nature of
Apollyon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my little girl for a walk round the garden,&rdquo;
said Mr. Herbert to young Leigh. &ldquo;I want to speak
to your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of the great gulf between her and the clay-bespattered
boy in his shirt sleeves, the little princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
was too glad of a change of scene to wish to disobey
her father. She followed her conductor to the back
of the house, and the boy and girl stepped out into the
autumnal sunshine.</p>

<p>The little maid looked so trim and dainty in her
neat riding-habit, coquettish hat and tiny gloves that
his own draggled appearance struck the boy forcibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse me a minute,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will
run and wash my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think it will be better,&rdquo; said Miss Herbert,
with dignity.</p>

<p>In a minute or two young Leigh returned. He had
found time not only to wash the rich red clay from his
long, well-shaped fingers, but to slip on his coat and
generally beautify himself. His improved appearance
had a great effect upon the child, who, like most of her
age, was influenced by exteriors.</p>

<p>So Miss Herbert, this little great lady, unbent and
allowed &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo; to lead her round the old-fashioned
garden, to the out-houses and pigsties, where the obese
pigs lay oblivious of what fate had in store for them;
to the stables; to the dairy, where she condescended
to drink a glass of new milk, and by the time they had
returned to the garden the two were as good friends as
their different stations in life would permit. Young
Leigh, who saw in this dainty little maid the incarnation
of fairies, nymphs, goddesses, and other ideals
which, in a dim way, were forming themselves in his
brain, endeavored, after his first shyness had passed
away, to show her what beautiful shapes and forms
could be found in flower, leaf, and tree, and other
things in nature. His talk, indeed, soared far above
her pretty little head, and when they returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
garden he was trying to make her see that those masses
of white clouds low down in the distance were two
bodies of warriors just about to meet in deadly fray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very, very funny boy,&rdquo; said Miss Herbert,
with such an air of conviction that he was startled
into silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name is Jerry, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s an ugly name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Gerald&mdash;Gerald Leigh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh; Gerald!&rdquo; Even this child could see the impropriety
of a tenant farmer having a son named
Gerald. No wonder Abraham Leigh addressed his
boy as Jerry!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like being a farmer?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going to be a farmer; I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity! Farmers are such a worthy, respectable
class of men,&rdquo; said the girl, using a stock phrase
she had caught up somewhere.</p>

<p>The boy laughed merrily. Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s approbation
sat newly upon him, and he was only talking to a
child; so he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to be worthy and respectable, but a much
greater man than a farmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! How great? as great as papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd, you know,&rdquo; said Miss Herbert, with
all the outraged family pride that thirteen years can feel;
and, turning away, she switched at the flowers with
her riding-whip.</p>

<p>However, a few words from Gerald made them
friends once more, and she expressed her pleasure that
he should pick her one of the few roses which remained
in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Roses are common,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Every one
gives roses. I will give you something prettier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the sunny side of the house, and soon
returned with half a dozen pale lavender stars in his
hands. They were blossoms of a new sort of late clematis,
which some one&rsquo;s gardener had given Abraham
Leigh. Gerald&rsquo;s deft fingers arranged them into a most
artistic bouquet, the appearance of which was entirely
spoilt by Miss Herbert&rsquo;s insistence that two or three
roses should be added. The bouquet was just finished
and presented when Mr. Herbert, followed by the
farmer, appeared.</p>

<p>Although he said nothing more to young Leigh on
the subject which was uppermost in the boy&rsquo;s mind, the
kindly encouraging look he gave him raised the widest
hopes in his heart. Mr. Herbert bade the father and
son a pleasant good-day, and rode off with his little
daughter.</p>

<p>Miss Herbert carried the bunch of clematis for about
two miles when, finding it rather encumbered her,
tossed it over a hedge.</p>

<p>Gerald Leigh went back to his attic and commenced
about half a dozen clay sketches of the prettiest object
which as yet had crossed his path. For several days
he was on thorns to hear what fate had in store for
him; but fate, personified by his father, made no sign,
but went about his work stolid and sphinx-like. Mr.
Herbert, Gerald learned, had gone to London for a few
days.</p>

<p>However, before a fortnight had gone by, Abraham
Leigh received a letter from his landlord, and the same
evening, whilst smoking his pipe in the farm kitchen,
informed his son and his sister that to-morrow he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
going into Gloucestershire to see if his brother Joseph
could spare him one of his many boys to take Jerry&rsquo;s
place. Jerry was to go to London the next day and
meet Mr. Herbert. Most likely he&rsquo;d stay there. &rsquo;Twas
clear as noontide the boy would never make a farmer,
and if there were fools enough in the world to buy
white figures at hundreds of pounds apiece, Jerry
might as well try to make his living that way as any
other.</p>

<p>The truth is, Mr. Herbert told Abraham Leigh that
if he would not consent to pay for his son&rsquo;s art education,
he, Mr. Herbert, would bear the expense himself.
But the monetary part of it troubled the substantial
farmer little. He could pay for his child&rsquo;s keep if he
could bring his mind to consent to his going. And
now the consent was given.</p>

<p>Gerald heard his father&rsquo;s communication with glowing
eyes. For shame&rsquo;s sake he hid his joy, for he knew
that, with all his stolid demeanor, his father almost
broke down as he contemplated the diverging paths
his son and he must henceforward thread. The boy
thanked him from his heart, and the rough farmer, laying
his hand on his child&rsquo;s head, blessed him and bade
him go and prosper.</p>

<p>In this way Gerald Leigh left Coombe-Acton. At
long intervals he reappeared for a few days. The
worthy villagers eyed him askance; the only conception
they could form of his profession being connected
with dark-skinned itinerants who bore double-tiered
platforms on their heads, and earned a precarious livehood
by traversing the country selling conventional
representations of angels and busts of eminent men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> seven years after the ambitious boy left Coombe-Acton,
honest farmer Abraham, just when the old-fashioned
hawthorn hedges were in whitest bloom,
sickened, turned his stolid face to the wall and died.
Gerald had been summoned, but arrived too late to see
his father alive. Perhaps it was as well it should be so,
the farmer&rsquo;s last moments were troubled ones and full
of regret that Watercress Farm would no longer know
a Leigh. The nephew who had taken Gerald&rsquo;s place
had turned out an utter failure, so much so that Abraham
Leigh had roundly declared that he would be
bothered with no more boys, and for the last few years
had managed his business single-handed. However,
although Gerald&rsquo;s upheaval of family traditions made
the farmer&rsquo;s deathbed unhappy, he showed that his son
had not forfeited his love. All he possessed, some
three thousand pounds, was left to him. Mr. Herbert
took the lease of the farm off the young man&rsquo;s hands,
by and by the live and the dead stock were sold off, and
Watercress Farm was waiting for another tenant.</p>

<p>The winding-up of the father&rsquo;s affairs kept Gerald
in the neighborhood of some weeks, and when it became
known that Mr. Herbert had insisted upon his taking
up his quarters at the hall the simple Coombe-Acton
folks were stricken with a great wonder. Knowing
nothing of what is called the &ldquo;aristocracy of art,&rdquo; their
minds were much exercised by such an unheard of proceeding.
What had &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo; Leigh being doing in the
last seven years to merit such a distinction?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing his agricultural friends could have understood.
After picking up the rudiments of his art in a
well-known sculptor&rsquo;s studio, young Leigh had been
sent to study in the schools at Paris. Mr. Herbert
told him that, so far as his art was concerned, Paris
was the workshop of the world,&mdash;Rome its bazaar and
showroom. So to Paris the boy went. He studied
hard and lived frugally. He won certain prizes and
medals, and was now looking forward to the time when
he must strike boldly for fame. Even now he was
not quite unknown. A couple of modest but very
beautiful studies in low relief had appeared in last
year&rsquo;s exhibition, and, if overlooked by the majority,
had attracted the notice of a few whose praise was well
worth winning. He was quite satisfied with the results
of his first attempt. In all things that concerned
his art he was wise and patient. No sooner had he
placed his foot on the lowest step of the ladder than he
realized the amount of work to be done&mdash;the technical
skill to be acquired before he could call himself a
sculptor. Even now, after seven years&rsquo; study and
labor, he had selfdenial enough to resolve upon being
a pupil for three years longer before he made his
great effort to place himself by the side of contemporary
sculptors. Passionate and impulsive as was his
true nature, he could follow and woo art with that
calm persistency and method which seem to be the
surest way of winning her smiles.</p>

<p>He is now a man&mdash;a singularly handsome man. If
not so tall as his youth promised, he is well built and
graceful. Artist is stamped all over him. Brow,
eyes, even the slender, well-shaped hands, proclaim it.
The general expression of his face is one of calm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
repose; yet an acute observer might assert that, when
the moment came, that face might depict passions
stronger than those which sway most men.</p>

<p>His dark hair and eyes, and something in the style
of his dress, gave him a look not quite that of an Englishman&mdash;a
look that terribly vexed poor Abraham
Leigh on those rare occasions when his erratic boy
paid him a visit; but, nevertheless, it is a look not out
of place on a young artist.</p>

<p>This is the kind of man Gerald Leigh has grown
into; and, whilst his transformation has been in progress,
Miss Eugenia Herbert has become a woman.</p>

<p>Although remembering every feature of the child,
who seemed in some way associated with the day of
his liberation, Gerald had not again seen her until his
father&rsquo;s death called him back to England. Each time
he had visited Coombe-Acton he had, of course, reported
progress to Mr. Herbert; but, shortly after the
change in his life, Mr. Herbert by a great effort of
self-denial, had sent his darling away to school, and at
school she had always been when Gerald called at the
Hall; but now, when he accepted Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s hospitality,
he found the fairy-like child grown, it seemed
to him, into his ideal woman, and found, moreover,
that there was a passion so intense that even the love
of art must pale before it.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to resist it. He let it master
him; overwhelm him; sweep him along. Ere a week
had gone by, not only by looks, but also in burning
words, he had told Eugenia he loved her. And how
did he fare?</p>

<p>His very audacity and disregard of everything, save
that he loved the girl, succeeded to a marvel. Eugenia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
had already met with many admirers, but not one like
this. Such passionate pleading, such fiery love, such
vivid eloquence were strange and new to her. There
was an originality, a freshness, a thoroughness in the
love he offered her. His very unreasonableness affected
her reason. All the wealth of his imagination, all the
crystallizations of his poetical dreams, he threw into
his passion. His ecstasy whirled the girl from her
mental feet; his warmth created an answering warmth;
his reckless pleading conquered. She forgot obstacles
as his eloquence overleaped them; she forgot social distinction
as his great dark eyes looked into hers, and at
last she confessed she loved him.</p>

<p>Then Gerald Leigh came down from the clouds and
realized what he had done, and as soon as he touched
the earth and became reasonable Eugenia fancied she
did not care for him quite so much.</p>

<p>His conscience smote him. Not only must Mr.
Herbert be reckoned with, but a terrible interval must
elapse before he had fame and fortune to lay before
Eugenia. He could scarcely expect her to leave her
luxurious home in order to live <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au quatrieme</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au
cinquieme</i> in Paris whilst he completed his studies.
He grew sad and downcast as he thought of these
things, and Eugenia, who liked pleasant, bright, well-to-do
people, felt less kindly disposed toward him and
showed she did so.</p>

<p>This made him reckless again. He threw the future
to the winds, recommenced his passionate wooing,
recovered his lost ground and gained, perhaps, a little
more.</p>

<p>But Abraham Leigh&rsquo;s affairs were settled up, and
Gerald knew he must tear himself from Acton Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and go back to work. He had lingered a few days to
finish a bust of Mr. Herbert. This done he had no
excuse for staying longer.</p>

<p>The summer twilight deepened into night. The
sculptor and Miss Herbert stood upon the broad and
gravelled terrace-walk that runs along the stately front
of Acton Hall. They leaned upon the gray stone balustrade;
the girl with musing eye was looking down on
shadowy lawn and flower-bed underneath; the young
man looked at her, and her alone. Silence reigned
long between them, but at last she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really go to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me to stay, and I will stay,&rdquo; he said, passionately,
&ldquo;but next week&mdash;next month&mdash;next year, the
moment, when it does come, will be just as bitter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not urge him. She was silent. He drew
very near to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eugenia,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; Her eyes were still looking over the
darkening garden. She spoke dreamily, and as one
who is not quite certain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so! Listen! Before we part let me
tell you what your love means to me. If, when first
I asked for it you had scorned me, I could have left
you unhappy, but still a man. Now it means life or
death to me. There is no middle course&mdash;no question
of joy or misery&mdash;simply life or death! Eugenia, look
at me and say you love me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His dark eyes charmed and compelled her. &ldquo;I love
you! I love you?&rdquo; she murmured. Her words satisfied
him; moreover, she let the hand he grasped remain in
his, perhaps even returning the pressure of his own.
So they stood for more than an hour, whilst Gerald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
talked of the future and the fame he meant to win&mdash;talked
as one who has the fullest confidence in his own
powers and directing genius.</p>

<p>Presently they saw Mr. Herbert walking through the
twilight towards them. Gerald&rsquo;s hand tightened on
the girl&rsquo;s so as to cause her positive pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;life or death! Think
of it while we are apart. Your love means a man&rsquo;s
life or death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many a lover has said an equally extravagant thing,
but Eugenia Herbert knew that his words were not
those of poetical imagery, and as she re-entered the
house she trembled at the passion she had aroused.
What if time and opposition should work a change in
her feelings? She tried to reassure herself by thinking
that if she did not love him in the same blind, reckless
way, at any rate she would never meet another man
whom she could love as she loved Gerald Leigh.</p>

<p>The sculptor went back to Paris&mdash;to his art and his
dreams of love and fame. Two years slipped by without
any event of serious import happening to the persons
about whom we are concerned. Then came a great
change.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert died so suddenly that neither doctor nor
lawyer could be summoned in time, either to aid him
to live or to carry out his last wishes. His will gave
Eugenia two thousand pounds and an estate he owned
in Gloucestershire&mdash;everything else to his son. Unfortunately,
some six months before, he had sold the
Gloucestershire property, and, with culpable negligence,
had not made a fresh will. Therefore, the
small money bequest was all that his daughter could
claim. However, this seemed of little moment, as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
brother at once announced his intention of settling
upon her the amount to which she was equitably entitled.
He had given his solicitors instructions to prepare
the deed.</p>

<p>James Herbert, Eugenia&rsquo;s brother, was unmarried,
and at present had no intention of settling down to
the life of a country gentleman. Six weeks after Mr.
Herbert&rsquo;s death the greater number of the servants
were paid off, and Acton Hall was practically shut up.
Eugenia, after spending some weeks with friends in
the north of England, came to London to live for an
indefinite time with her mother&rsquo;s sister, a Mrs. Cathcart.</p>

<p>Since her father&rsquo;s death Gerald Leigh had written to
her several times&mdash;letters full of passionate love and
penned as if the writer felt sure of her constancy and
wish to keep her promise. He, too, was coming to
London. Had she wished it, he would at once have
come to her side; but as it was he would take up his
quarters in town about the same time Eugenia arrived
there.</p>

<p>The hour was at hand&mdash;the hour to which Miss Herbert
had for two years looked forward with strangely
mingled feelings&mdash;when her friends must be told that
she intended to marry the young, and as yet unknown
sculptor, Gerald Leigh, the son of her father&rsquo;s late
tenant farmer, Abraham.</p>

<p>She loved him still. She felt sure of that much.
If time and absence had somewhat weakened the spell
he had thrown over her proud nature, she knew that
unless the man was greatly changed the magic of his
words and looks would sway her as irresistibly as before.
She loved him, yet rebelled against her fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Her father had died ignorant of what had passed
between his daughter and the young artist. Many a
time Eugenia had tried to bring herself to confess the
truth to him. She now regretted she had not done so.
Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s approval or disapproval would have
been at least a staff by which to guide her steps. He
had suspected nothing. The few letters which passed
between the lovers had been unnoticed. Their love
was as yet a secret known only to themselves.</p>

<p>She loved him, but why had he dared to make her
love him? Or, why was he not well-born and wealthy?
Could she find strength to face, for his sake, the scorn
of her friends?</p>

<p>She must decide at once. She is sitting and thinking
all these things in her own room at Mrs. Cathcart&rsquo;s,
and in front of her lies a letter in which Gerald announces
his intention of calling upon her to-morrow.
She knows that if she receives him she will be bound
to proclaim herself his affianced wife.</p>

<p>He called. She saw him. Mrs. Cathcart was out,
So Eugenia was alone when the servant announced Mr.
Leigh. She started and turned pale. She trembled
in every limb as he crossed the room to where she
stood. He took her hand and looked into her face.
He spoke, and his rich musical voice thrilled her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eugenia, is it life or death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not answer. She could not turn her eyes
from his. She saw the intensity of their expression
deepen; saw a fierce yearning look come into them, a
look which startled her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it life or death?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>His love conquered. &ldquo;Gerald, it is life,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Drunk with joy, he threw his arms around her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
kissed her until the blushes dyed her cheeks. He
stayed with her as long as she would allow, but his delight
was too delicious to permit him to say much
about his plans for the future. When at last she made
him leave her, he gave her the number of a studio at
Chelsea, which he had taken, and she promised to
write and let him know when he might call again.</p>

<p>They parted. Eugenia walked to the window, and
for a long time looked out on the gay thoroughfare,
now full of carriages going to and returning from the
park. Of course, she loved Gerald dearly; that was
now beyond a doubt. But what would she have to go
through when the engagement was announced? what
had she to look forward to as his wife? Must love
and worldly misery be synonymous?</p>

<p>The current of her thoughts was interrupted by the
arrival of another visitor&mdash;her brother. James
Herbert was a tall young man, faultlessly dressed, and
bearing a general look of what is termed high breeding.
He bore a likeness to his father, but the likeness
was but an outward one. By this time he was a cold
cynical man of the world. He had not lived the best
of lives, but, being no fool, had gained experience and
caution. He was clever enough to study human nature
with a view of turning his knowledge to account.
Eugenia had some pride of birth; her brother had, or
affected, a great deal more. He was by no means unpopular;
few men could make themselves more agreeable
and fascinating than James Herbert when it was
worth his while to be so. In his way he was fond of
his sister; certainly proud of her beauty; and she,
who knew nothing of his true nature, thought him as
perfect as a brother can be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>He kissed her, complimented her on her good looks,
then sat down and made himself pleasant. She answered
his remarks somewhat mechanically, wondering
all the time what effect her news would have upon
him. She hated things hanging over her head, and
had made up her mind to tell him of her intentions, if
not to-day the next time she met him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lawyers have almost settled your little matter,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you I made up my mind at
once; things haven&rsquo;t turned out so well as we expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thanked him&mdash;not effusively, as if he was doing
no more than she had a right to expect. Yet the
thought flashed across her that before she took his
bounty she was by honor compelled to make him acquainted
with what she proposed doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye, Eugenia,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;you know
Ralph Norgate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He called a day or two ago. I did not see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I expect he&rsquo;ll soon call again. He has been
forcing his friendship on me lately. In fact&mdash;I&rsquo;d better
tell you&mdash;his mind is made up&mdash;you are to be the
future Lady Norgate. Now you know what to look
forward to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face flushed. Her troubles were beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, James,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;I was just going to
tell you&mdash;I am already engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows. To express great surprise
was against his creed, and the idea that Eugenia was
capable of disgracing herself did not enter his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the worse for Norgate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who
is the happy man?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be angry, very angry, I fear.&rdquo; She spoke
timidly. His manner told her she had good grounds
for fear. His mouth hardened, but he still spoke politely
and pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, don&rsquo;t discount my displeasure; tell
me who it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Gerald Leigh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty name, and one which sounds familiar to
me. Now, who is Gerald Leigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a sculptor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! now I know. Son of that excellent old tenant
of my father&rsquo;s. The genius he discovered on a
dungheap. Eugenia, are you quite mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be a famous man some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herbert shrugged his shoulders in a peculiarly irritating
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him be as famous as he likes. What does it
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The proudest family may be proud of allying themselves
to a great artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herbert looked at his sister with a pitying but
amused smile. &ldquo;My poor girl, don&rsquo;t be led astray by
the temporary glorification of things artistic. When
these fellows grow talked about we ask them to our
houses and make much of them. It&rsquo;s the fashion. But
we don&rsquo;t marry them. Indeed, as they all begin in the
lower ranks of life, like your friend, they are generally
provided with wives of their own station, who stay at
home and trouble no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She winced under the sting of his scorn. He saw
it, and knew he was pursuing the right treatment for
her disease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, this young Leigh,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
will he be for years and years? A sort of superior
stone-cutter. He will make what living he can by going
about and doing busts of mayors and mayoresses,
and other people of that class, who want their common
features perpetuated. Perhaps he might get a
job on a tombstone for a change. Bah! Of course
you have been jesting with me, Eugenia. I shall tell
Norgate to call as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall marry Gerald Leigh,&rdquo; said Eugenia, sullenly.
All the same the busts and tombstones weighed
heavily upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said her brother, rising, and still speaking
with a smile, &ldquo;I am not the least afraid of, although
you are of age and mistress of two thousand pounds.
You are not cut out to ornament an attic. I need
not say I must countermand that settlement. It must
wait until you marry Norgate or some other suitable
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her and walked carelessly away. To all
appearance the matter did not cause him a moment&rsquo;s
anxiety. He was a clever man, and flattered himself
he knew how to treat Eugenia; human nature should
be assailed at its weakest points.</p>

<p>His carelessness was, of course, assumed; for, meeting
Mrs. Cathcart as she drove home, Eugenia&rsquo;s news
was sufficiently disturbing to make him stop the carriage,
seat himself beside his aunt, and beg her to take
another turn in the park, during which he told her
what had transpired.</p>

<p>They were fitting coadjutors. Mrs. Cathcart was
delighted to hear of Sir Ralph&rsquo;s overtures, and was
shocked to find that Eugenia was entangled in some
low attachment. She quite agreed that the girl must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
be led, not driven; must be laughed, not talked, out
of her folly. &ldquo;Girls nearly always make fools of
themselves once in their lives,&rdquo; said Mr. Cathcart,
cynically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; said James Herbert, who knew something
about the sex. &ldquo;All the same, Eugenia shall
not. Find out all about the fellow, where he lives,
and all the rest of it. She doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;ve told you
about this. Keep a sharp lookout for any letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the next day, when Eugenia and her aunt were
together, the latter, a skilled domestic diplomatist,
commenced operations by regretting that Mr. Herbert,
although so fond of statuary, had never employed a
sculptor to make his own bust. Mrs. Cathcart spoke
so naturally that Eugenia fell into the trap, and informed
her that Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s likeness had been taken
in clay two years ago by a young sculptor then staying
at Acton Hall. It had been done for pleasure, not
profit, but her father had always intended to order a
copy in marble. Mrs. Cathcart was delighted. Did
Eugenia know where the young man could be found?</p>

<p>Eugenia did know. She told her with a tinge of
color on her cheeks, and took advantage of the opportunity,
and perhaps soothed her spirit somewhat by
expatiating on what a great man her lover was to
become. Mrs. Cathcart, in return, spoke of geniuses
as struggling, poverty stricken persons, to befriend
whom was the one great wish of her life. It was
indeed pleasant for Miss Herbert to hear her aunt
speak of her lover as she might of a hard-working
seamstress or deserving laundress. She had not yet
written to Gerald. She must find strength to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
off her brother&rsquo;s scorn and the busts and tombstones
before she again met her lover.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Norgate called that morning. He was
a man of about forty. Not ill-looking, but with the
unmistakable appearance of one who had led a hard
life. He was rich, and of fine old family. It was
clear to Mrs. Cathcart that he meant business. Eugenia
had met him several times last year, and it was
no news to her that he was her ardent admirer. She
was very cold towards him to-day, but Mrs. Cathcart
did not chide her. She, clever woman, knew that
men like Norgate value a prize at what it costs them
to win it. So the baronet came, stayed his appointed
time, then went away, presumably in fair train to a
declaration by and by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, whilst driving with her niece, Mrs.
Cathcart was seized by a sudden thought. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;let us go and see about that bust. Where
did you say the sculptor man was to be found? Nelson
Studios, King&rsquo;s Road. What number?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 10,&rdquo; said Eugenia, wondering if her aunt&rsquo;s
sudden resolve would be productive of good or evil.</p>

<p>The carriage went to Nelson Studios; the ladies dismounted,
and Mrs. Cathcart tapped at the door of
No. 10, a studio which, being a sculptor&rsquo;s, was of
course on the ground-floor.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a handsome young man
whose outside garb was a ragged old blouse, and whose
hands were white with half-dried clay&mdash;one of those
hands, moreover, held a short pipe. Indeed, Gerald
Leigh was in as unpresentable trim as when years ago
he first met Miss Herbert.</p>

<p>He did not at once see the girl. She was behind
Mrs. Cathcart, and that lady&rsquo;s majestic presence absorbed
all his attention. Mrs. Cathcart put up her
eye-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your master in?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Gerald laughed. &ldquo;I am my own master,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Leigh, aunt,&rdquo; said Eugenia, coming
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Cathcart, and the palpable meaning
of that exclamatory monosyllable sent the blood
to Eugenia&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>Gerald started as he heard the girl&rsquo;s voice and recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
her in the shadow. He stretched out his clay-covered
hand, then withdrew it and laughed. Mrs.
Cathcart, who saw the action, put on a look of supreme
astonishment; then she recovered herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; she said to Eugenia. &ldquo;Of course,
you have seen Mr. Leigh before. May we come in,
Mr. Leigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved aside and the ladies entered the studio.
He placed his two chairs at their disposal. He wondered
the while what had brought Eugenia to him.
He gave her a questioning glance, but her eyes avoided
his. Then Mrs. Cathcart began. She spoke in that
manner which certain persons assume towards those
whom they are pleased to think their inferiors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe, some time ago, you made a bust of my
late brother-in-law, Mr. Herbert, of Coombe-Acton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to have a copy of it. Can you make one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. In marble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In marble, of course. How much will it cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a painful experience to Eugenia, to hear her
future husband talked to by Mrs. Cathcart much as
that lady talked to the obliging young men and women
at the various emporiums which enjoyed her patronage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Herbert was my best friend,&rdquo; said Gerald.
&ldquo;My services are at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cathcart,
coldly. &ldquo;I asked you what it would cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald colored and glanced at Eugenia. He was utterly
puzzled. It could only have been through the
agency of the girl he loved that this new patroness
sought him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Leigh was my father&rsquo;s friend, aunt,&rdquo; said
Eugenia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear! Mr. Leigh is not <em>my</em> friend. I want to
know his terms for a marble bust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighty pounds, madam,&rdquo; said Gerald, rather
shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, much too much! Eugenia, do you not think
such a price extortionate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eugenia was silent, but her cheeks burned. Gerald&rsquo;s
lip quivered with anger. Only Mrs. Cathcart
was calm. &ldquo;I will pay you forty pounds,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but then it must be approved by a competent judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard my terms, madam,&rdquo; said Leigh
curtly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absurd! I will even say fifty pounds. If you
like to take that you may call upon me. Good-morning.
Come, Eugenia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swept out of the studio. Eugenia followed
her. She looked back and saw Gerald&rsquo;s face wearing
an expression of actual pain. For a moment her impulse
was to run back, throw her arms round his neck,
and defy every one. However, she did not yield to it,
but followed her aunt to the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call that young man a most common, ill-bred
person,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cathcart.</p>

<p>Eugenia flushed. &ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; she said hotly.
&ldquo;Your manner towards him must have been most
mortifying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Cathcart, in innocent
surprise, &ldquo;and I was trying to befriend the
young man? He presumes on his acquaintance with
your father. I always told your poor father it was a
mistake becoming intimate with persons of that class.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugenia said no more. If she had thought of so
doing it was not the moment to open her heart to Mrs.
Cathcart. She went to her room intending to write to
Gerald; but no letter was written that day. How
could she ask him to call at her aunt&rsquo;s after what
had occurred?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love him,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;but I am not
brave enough to give up all for him. Oh, why did
we ever meet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning she received a letter from Gerald.
It contained no reproach&mdash;only an entreaty that she
would name a time when he might see her. Mrs.
Cathcart was true to her duty. Before James Herbert
was out of bed she had sent him word that a
letter had come for Eugenia. He went at once to his
sister. His greeting was quite friendly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eugenia,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;of course by now
you have put all that nonsense about that sculptor-fellow
out of your pretty head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you mean to be obstinate I must interfere.
Have you seen him since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt went to his studio. I was with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ought to have known better. If she encourages
you we shall quarrel. Do you correspond? Tell
me the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She offered him Gerald&rsquo;s letter. He waved it aside
as a thing beneath his notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you answered it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet. I am just going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her brother still remained calm and polite, with
that contemptuous, incredulous smile playing round
his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will make a fool of yourself, I can&rsquo;t stop
you. If you, with your beauty and position, choose to
go and live in a garret, you must do so. Still, as your
brother, I have certain responsibilities which would
still be mine were your lover the highest in the land.
I must make inquiries as to his character and moral
worth&mdash;these fellows are generally a loose lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may make what inquiries you choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Now one favor&mdash;a command, the last
I shall ask or give. You will not answer this letter&mdash;you
will not see the man&mdash;until I have satisfied myself
on these points. It is not too much to ask, Eugenia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt the justice of his remarks&mdash;could it be she
was weak enough to be glad of a little delay and
breathing space? But Gerald&rsquo;s face, as last she saw
it, rose before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must name a time,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So impatient for true love and social extinction,&rdquo;
sneered Herbert. &ldquo;Surely you can restrain yourself
until this day week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was longer than she had meant. But her brother&rsquo;s
bitter sneers settled it. &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;until this day week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The promise given James Herbert dismissed the
matter, but he filled up the next half-hour with the
very cream of society gossip, which was undoubtedly
as palatable to Eugenia as it would have been to any
other woman. James Herbert lived within the inner
circle, and as to-day, for purposes of his own, he spoke
to Eugenia as if she were one of the initiated; his conversation
was not without charm.</p>

<p>He was clever to know when to trust. He had not
the slightest fear that Eugenia would break her promise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
So he cautioned Mrs. Cathcart to keep the
little fool well within sight, and thus avoid danger of
a chance meeting; to order the servants to refuse the
sculptor admission if he ventured to call&mdash;and above
all to be sure that Norgate had every opportunity of
pressing his suit. After this he waited calmly, and did
nothing more in the matter for six whole days.</p>

<p>Days during which Gerald Leigh chafed and fretted.
He refused to doubt, but his heart grew heavy within
him. He felt sure that Mrs. Cathcart&rsquo;s visit boded no
good. At last he could bear the suspense no longer.
He called and asked for Eugenia. She was out. He
called again&mdash;the same result. He went back to his
studio and tried to conquer his growing uneasiness by
hard work. One morning a gentleman called and
introduced himself as James Herbert.</p>

<p>Gerald received him courteously. Herbert was
suave, smiling and bland. He spoke of the interest
he felt in the young sculptor for his father, Mr.
Herbert&rsquo;s sake. He admired some embryo designs,
and wished and prophesied all success. Then, as
Gerald began to hope that Eugenia&rsquo;s brother might
some day be his friend, he turned upon him and tore
him to pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, after all, Mr. Leigh, my great object in calling
concerns my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald grew very pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a good girl, but weak. She has confessed
to me that some sort of romantic nonsense had passed
between you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has vowed to be my wife&mdash;no more, no less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His impetuosity seemed to amuse Herbert. &ldquo;I am
afraid such a thing is an impossibility,&rdquo; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
serenely. &ldquo;I shall not insult you by telling you she is
all but penniless&mdash;geniuses, I know, never think of
money&mdash;but I fear I must pain you by saying she
repents of her hasty words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Gerald slowly, yet fiercely, &ldquo;is a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good sir, I cannot allow you to use such words.
My temper is fair, but it has its limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I apologize,&rdquo; said Gerald sullenly. &ldquo;I should
have said you were coercing her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never coerced any one in my life; much less my
sister. Naturally, I shall object to her marriage with
you; but that makes no difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you have to tell,&rdquo; said Gerald
nervously. He hated and feared this smooth, smiling
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a few words, then, my sister is unhappy and
unsettled. For several days she has been trying to
answer a letter you sent her. At last she confided all
to me. I am sure I am not going too far when I say
she would be glad to think that all boy and girl
promises between you were forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sent you to tell me this?&rdquo; asked Gerald
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. She knew I was coming. I am putting her
thoughts in my own words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to understand what my love for
your sister means; you could not,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;But
you know she has vowed to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and will keep her promise if you insist upon
it.&rdquo; The emphasis Herbert laid on insist made
Gerald&rsquo;s heart sick.</p>

<p>He said nothing; but, with a strange smile on his
white face, he went to a table and wrote a few words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
He handed the paper to his visitor. &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;you say you are her messenger; now you can
be mine.&rdquo; The words were:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eugenia: If this is unanswered I shall believe
you wish to recall everything that has passed between
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;This is all I could
expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With trembling hands the sculptor placed the paper
in an envelope, and once more tendered it to Herbert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;People have
been tempted to suppress letters before now. Post it
in the ordinary way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald left the room. He returned in a few moments,
and Herbert knew that the letter had been
posted. He had nothing further to do with Gerald,
so held out his hand affably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;I would rather not.&rdquo; His eyes
were gleaming strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said Herbert with indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will change my mind,&rdquo; said Gerald in a low
voice, and taking the other&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;condemned people
always shake hands with the hangman, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke with a ghastly attempt at mirth. Herbert
left the studio without another word, but, as he drove
to Mrs. Cathcart&rsquo;s, said to himself, &ldquo;The sooner that
beggar shoots or hangs himself the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went straight to his sister. He placed his hand
on her shoulder, and, with a look she had never yet
seen on his face, said in a cold, contemptuous manner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eugenia, I have been taking some trouble on your
behalf. To-day two things are going to happen which
will settle your future. Norgate will be here presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and ask you to be his wife. By the next post you will
get a letter from that stone-cutter. Before you answer
it, shut yourself up and think until you are in a proper
frame of mind. Women are fools, but surely you
can&rsquo;t be the biggest among them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen him?&rdquo; asked Eugenia faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. An extremely nice young man&mdash;in his place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, and very comfortable. My dear girl,
he quite won my respect&mdash;a thoroughly practical
young man, with lots of common-sense. Now good-bye.
Don&rsquo;t make any mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did she hear aright? Her brother found Gerald a
thoroughly practical young man! The lie was so gigantic
that it seemed impossible it could be all a lie.
She was revolving it in her mind even when Sir Ralph
Norgate was announced.</p>

<p>As for the practical young man, he had locked his
door, and thrown himself on the ground. James
Herbert&rsquo;s words had impressed him, and perhaps his
faith in Eugenia&rsquo;s faith was not so great as he fancied.
To-morrow he would know the verdict. He felt sure
that if his letter remained unanswered for twenty-four
hours James Herbert had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>Miss Herbert found her brother a true prophet.
Sir Ralph Norgate offered his hand, and when the
offer was refused, told her he did not mean to accept
her answer as final. She did not, on her part, say anything
about her love being given elsewhere. Then
Gerald&rsquo;s letter came, and following her brother&rsquo;s advice
she did think everything over; she sat for hours
trying to nerve herself to answer the letter as love and
faith demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>She loved him. Had he been present her indecision
would soon have vanished; but, as it was, she could
reflect fully on what an answer to his letter must mean&mdash;alienation
of all her friends&mdash;an end of social ambition&mdash;many
years, if not a life, of poverty. Eugenia
shuddered as she thought of the consequences, and
wished that she and Gerald had never met. She
wished moreover, that the temptations of rank and
wealth held out by her other suitor were less.</p>

<p>What would Gerald do if his letter was not answered?
If she could but persuade herself that her
brother&rsquo;s estimate of his character was the right one!
Possibly it might be; James knew mankind well. If
she could but think so&mdash;could believe that Gerald
would forget&mdash;she might then find it easier to be wise,
and, by taking him at his word, save herself and perhaps
him from what must insure unhappiness.</p>

<p>So she reasoned&mdash;so she excused her half-meditated
treason&mdash;so she persuaded herself it would eventually
be better for both if they parted. Yet all the
while she knew she loved Gerald Leigh as she could
love no other man. In this mental conflict the day
passed and night found the letter unanswered. Then
James Herbert came to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eugenia, have you replied to that letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She did so. It was a relief to get rid of it. He
tore it into fragments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew I could trust your good
sense. There is an end of the affair. It is a secret
between you and me, and I shall never again allude
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>For good or ill the die was cast. She had freed herself.
But she had left the room with swimming eyes,
and went to Mrs. Cathcart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;will you take me abroad&mdash;for a
long time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hard for Mrs. Cathcart to be called upon to
give up the rest of the London season. But then Mr.
Herbert&rsquo;s recent death prevented her going out much,
and it was paramount that Eugenia&rsquo;s future should be
satisfactorily disposed of. So the excellent woman
sacrificed herself at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take you abroad, Eugenia, if you will promise
to be Sir Ralph&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eugenia had chosen her own path, and knew where
it would lead; yet for very shame she would not show
her thoughts to others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can promise nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take me
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three days afterward, Gerald Leigh learned that
Eugenia had gone abroad with her aunt.</p>

<p>Although in his studio all day long, the sculptor did
no work for weeks; at last he aroused himself, engaged
a model and set to work with feverish energy. From
morn to night he thumbed and pushed about the ductile
clay. He laughed in a sort of bitter triumph. His
hands had not lost their cunning. The work grew and
grew apace until the clay was done with, and a fair
white block of marble stood in the centre of the studio
waiting to be hewn into the statue which was to be
Gerald Leigh&rsquo;s first high bid for fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was early in May. The Academy had been open
about a week, long enough for the newspaper critics
to tell the public what it ought to admire. Strange to
say, this year the critics were unanimous in bestowing
their highest praises on a piece of statuary, and a great
future for the sculptor was predicted.</p>

<p>No. 1460 in the catalogue appealed to no one by
cheap sentiment or sensational treatment. It was but
the lightly-draped figure of a beautiful girl; one in the
first flush of womanhood. She was in the act of stepping
hastily forward. Her arms were extended as if
to welcome, perhaps embrace, some one who was coming
towards her. Her face bore a smile of eager delight.
The grace, the likeness, the life of the figure
arrested each passer by. The fall of the drapery, the
position of each well-rounded limb, conveyed the idea
of rapid motion. It was indeed hard to believe that
she was doomed to remain forever in one fixed attitude.
The stock remark of the spectators was that
in a minute they expected to see her at the other side
of the room.</p>

<p>This statute bore no distinguishing title, but those
persons who turned to their catalogues found, under the
number and the artist&rsquo;s name, a few words of poetry:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Her hands outstretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet the new love; whilst her feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tread, scornful, on the old love&rsquo;s gifts.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>After reading this one turned, of course, to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
feet, and found that one of them was treading on flowers&mdash;roses
and large star-shaped blossoms.</p>

<p>Several people, whilst admiring the statue, fancied
they had somewhere seen the original of that beautiful
face; but, save the sculptor, only one, James Herbert,
knew the truth. He cursed Leigh&rsquo;s impertinence, but
was too wise to take any notice of it. Yet he determined
to keep Eugenia from the Academy, if possible.</p>

<p>She was in town, and in a week&rsquo;s time was to be
married to Sir Ralph. Two months after Mrs. Cathcart
had taken her niece abroad, the baronet joined
them, and renewed his proposals; this time with success.
The girl stipulated that the marriage should not
take place until the spring. The truth is she wanted
some months&rsquo; delay in order to get rid of the memories
of Gerald Leigh, and by the time she returned to England
flattered herself she had successfully completed
the operation.</p>

<p>She had in the last few days heard some talk about
the statue, but had steadfastly kept her eyes from the
art criticisms, fearing to see Gerald&rsquo;s name. Nevertheless,
she wished to visit the Academy, and was
surprised when James Herbert, now amiability itself,
refused to take her there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t go this year,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that fellow&rsquo;s
statute is creating quite a furore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of that!&rdquo; asked Eugenia, coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has had bad taste enough to represent you. The
likeness is unmistakable. It is a maudlin thing&mdash;a
girl deserting her old love, or some such nonsense.
Still, you&rsquo;d better not go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eugenia said no more, but all day long she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
thinking of her brother&rsquo;s words, and longing to see
what Gerald had wrought. That evening she dined
out. At the table were several persons who worshipped
art, and Eugenia&rsquo;s cheek burned as she heard the
praise bestowed on the new sculptor and the great future
prophesied for him. Had she, after all, been
wrong? Would it not have been better to have followed
the mandates of her heart? Had she not been
weak and mercenary? No matter; it was too late now
to repent. Poor Gerald! She must see this wonderful
image of herself.</p>

<p>Early next morning she went alone to Burlington
House. Unlike others, she knew the meaning of the
statue, knew the mute reproach it conveyed, knew why
the marble foot trod down those particular flowers.
She had never told him the fate of his boyish gift; but
Gerald had often and often recalled his first meeting
with her. Eugenia&rsquo;s heart swelled as she remembered
his brave words and confidence in himself&mdash;how sure
he felt of success. He had, indeed, succeeded, but the
first great work from his hands was a memento of his
love for a faithless woman&mdash;herself.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen were at her side. They were talking
of the work and the sculptor. One of them she
knew. He was a lord, famous for his love of art and
encouragement of rising artists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried to buy it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but found it was not
for sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Commercially speaking,&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;it is
as well you cannot buy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? The man must go to the top of his profession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. Indeed, my belief is he will do little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
more. I have inquired about him. He does not live
the life a genius must live in these days if he wants
to succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; said Lord &mdash;&mdash;, moving
away.</p>

<p>Miss Herbert left the Academy with an echo of
Gerald&rsquo;s extravagant statement that life or death hung
upon her love sounding in her ears. The conversation
she had overheard distressed her greatly. The thought
that her treachery had ruined a life full of promise
would not be dismissed. She spent a most miserable
day, and its misery was not diminished by the truth,
which she could no longer conceal from herself, that
she still loved Gerald. She loved him more than ever.
Too late! too late! And Eugenia Herbert wept, as
many others have wept, that the past could not be undone.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Norgate and James Herbert dined that
evening at Mrs. Cathcart&rsquo;s. Their society was little
comfort to Eugenia. She felt now that she hated her
lover&mdash;hated his polite, hollow society ways and expressions&mdash;hated
that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> look which so often settled
on his face. She had never cared for him. Their
love-making had been of a frigid kind&mdash;not, be it said,
by Sir Ralph&rsquo;s wish. He was proud of, and perhaps
really fond of, the beautiful girl he had bought; so it
was scarcely fair that Eugenia should compare his
polite wooing with that of the impassioned boy&rsquo;s,
which recked no obstacles&mdash;heeded no consequences.</p>

<p>Her bitter thoughts made it impossible for her to
sit out the dinner. Very soon she pleaded headache
and went to her own room to resume her self-revilings.
She made no further attempt to banish Gerald from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
her thoughts. She lived again every moment she had
spent in his company&mdash;heard again every word of wild
love&mdash;felt his hand close on hers&mdash;his lips press her
own&mdash;and shuddered as the dismal words &ldquo;Life or
death,&rdquo; seemed echoing through her ears. If she
could but undo the past!</p>

<p>Why not! The thought rushed through her. What
hindered her save the false gods to whom she had
bent? She was still legally free. Gerald was in the
same town. Why should she heed her friends? Why
trouble as to what people would think or say? By one
bold step she could right everything. If to-morrow&mdash;nay,
this very hour&mdash;she went to Gerald and bade him
take her and hold her against all, she knew he would
do so. He would forgive. To him her action would
not seem bold or unmaidenly. In his eyes she would
rank as high as ever; and what mattered the rest?
To-morrow they might be miles away, and the bliss of
being Gerald&rsquo;s wife might well compensate for what
people would say about her conduct. She herself
could forget all, save that she was now bound forever
to the man she loved!</p>

<p>She would do it. With feverish impatience she
threw off her rich dress and wrapped herself in a plain
cloak. She put on the quietest hat she could find, stole
down stairs, and was out of the house before second
thoughts had time to bring irresolution. Her heart
beat wildly. She hailed a cab and was driven to
Nelson Studios. On the way she remembered it was
an unlikely hour to find an artist in his studio, but,
nevertheless, now she had set out, resolved to complete
her journey.</p>

<p>She walked quickly to Gerald&rsquo;s door. She knocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
softly, but met with no response. She dared not wait
longer outside. The pictured consequences of her rash
act were assuming tremendous proportions in her brain.
Another minute&rsquo;s delay and she must leave the spot
never to return. She turned the handle of the door
and entered the room.</p>

<p>Now, Miss Herbert&rsquo;s half-formed plan of action
when she found herself face to face with her ill-treated
lover, had been something like this&mdash;she would
walk up to him and simply say, &ldquo;Gerald, I am come.&rdquo;
The rest must be left to him, but she believed, in spite
of her weakness and treachery, he would freely forgive
her all.</p>

<p>Gerald was not in the studio. The gas was half-turned
down, and the clay casts on the wall looked
grim and spectral. But, if Gerald was not in the
room it was still inhabited. On a low couch&mdash;a couch
covered by a rich Oriental rug&mdash;lay a woman, fast
asleep.</p>

<p>She crept across the room and gazed on the sleeper.
Even by the dim gas-light she knew that she gazed on
beauty before which her own must pale. The woman
might have been some five years older than herself, and
those wonderful charms were at their zenith. The
rich, clear, warm color on the cheek, the long black
lashes, the arched and perfect eyebrows, told of
Southern lands. The full, voluptuous figure, the
shapely, rounded arms, the red lips, the soft creamy
neck&mdash;before these the heart of man would run as wax
before a fire. Eugenia, seeking her lover, found this
woman in her stead.</p>

<p>A bitter, scornful smile played on Miss Herbert&rsquo;s
lips as she gazed at the sleeper. Somehow that oval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sunny face seemed familiar to her. Well might it be.
In London, Paris, everywhere, she had seen it in the
shop windows. There were few people in France or
England who had not heard the name of Mlle. Carlotta,
singer, dancer, darling of opera-bouffe, whose adventures
and amours were notorious, who had ruined more
men than she could count on the fingers of her fair
hands.</p>

<p>Eugenia recognized her, and her smile of scorn
deepened. The sight of a half-emptied champagne
bottle close to the sleeper, a half-smoked cigarette
lying on the floor just as it had fallen from her fingers,
added nothing to the contempt Miss Herbert&rsquo;s smile
expressed. Gathering her skirts together to avoid any
chance of contamination by touch, she was preparing
to leave the studio as noiselessly as she had entered it,
when suddenly the sleeper awoke.</p>

<p>Awoke without any warning. Simply opened her
splendid dark eyes, stared for half a second, then, with
wonderful lightness and agility, sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que faites vous la?</i> Why are you here?&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>Without a word Eugenia moved towards the door.
Mlle. Carlotta was before her. She turned the key
and placed her back against the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doucement! doucement! ma belle</i>,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Permit me to know who honors me with a visit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wished to see Mr. Leigh. I suppose he is out.
Be good enough to let me pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a model, then? But no; models look not
as you look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a model.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fi donc!</i> You are, perhaps, one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
young misses who write Geraldo letters of love. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A la
bonne heure!</i> I wish to see one of them&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moi</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a saucy smile Carlotta pocketed the key,
turned up the gas, and commenced a cool scrutiny of
her prisoner. Eugenia blushed crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui vous etes belle, ma chere&mdash;belle mais blonde</i>,
and Geraldo, he loves not the blonde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me pass!&rdquo; said Eugenia, stamping her foot.</p>

<p>Her tormentor laughed, but not ill-temperedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will soon be here,&rdquo; she said mockingly.
&ldquo;Surely Mademoiselle will wait. He will be enchanted
to see one of the young misses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mlle. Carlotta, when not injured, was not vindictive
or unkindly; but she was as mischievous as a
monkey. No doubt, having teased the girl to her
satisfaction, she would have soon released her, but it
happened that Eugenia turned her head, and for the first
time the light shone full upon her face. Her gaoler
started. She sprang towards her, seized her arm and
dragged her across the room. Still holding her captive,
she tore down a sheet and revealed the clay model
of the statue which had made Gerald famous. She
looked from the lifeless to the living face then burst
into a peal of derisive laughter. Eugenia&rsquo;s secret was
discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! The young miss that Geraldo loved.
The one who threw him away for a rich lover! Yet,
she wishes to see him again&mdash;so at night she comes.
Ah, Mademoiselle, you have w-r-r-recked him, c-r-r-rushed
him, r-r-ruined him, still would see him. Good;
good! it is now his turn. My Gerald shall have
revenge&mdash;revenge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eugenia, thoroughly aroused, commanded her to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
her go. Carlotta laughed in her face, was even ill-bred
enough to snap her fingers and poke out her tongue at
her prisoner. Eugenia humbled herself, and implored
her by their common womanhood. Carlotta laughed
the louder. Eugenia appealed to her venality, and tried
to bribe her. Carlotta lowered her black eyebrows and
scowled, but laughed louder than ever. &ldquo;He will come
very soon,&rdquo; was all she said. &ldquo;He will not stop long
away from me&mdash;Carlotta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Herbert was at her wit&rsquo;s end. Yet, even through
the shame of the situation, the anguish of her heart
made itself felt. After having wrought herself up to
make such a sacrifice, such an atonement, it was pitiable
to find Gerald no better than the rest of his sex!
She sat upon a chair longing for release, yet dreading
to hear the step which would herald it.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Mlle. Carlotta whiled it away
by emptying a glass of champagne, smoking a cigarette,
and making comments upon Gerald&rsquo;s prolonged absence.
Presently she cried, &ldquo;Ah, Mademoiselle, this
is dull for you; see, I will dance to you,&rdquo; and therewith
she raised herself on her toes and went pirouetting
round her captive, humming the while an air of Offenbach&rsquo;s.
Her dress was long, but she managed it with
marvellous skill, and Eugenia, whilst loathing, could not
help watching her with a sort of fascination. She was
as agile as a panther; every attitude was full of grace,
every gesture alluring.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped short. Her great eyes sparkled
even more brightly. She glanced at her victim. &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I hear him. I know his step. He comes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment afterwards the door was tried. Eugenia
covered her face with her hands. She knew not what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the woman meant to do or say, but she felt that her
crowning shame was at hand. Yet her heart beat at the
thought of seeing Gerald once more, and a wild idea of
forgiveness on either side passed through her.</p>

<p>Mlle. Carlotta turned down the gas, unlocked the
door, and, as it opened, threw herself into the arms of
the new-comer. Eugenia heard the sound of kisses
given and returned, and her heart grew like stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geraldo, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>,&rdquo; she heard the dancer say in
passionate tones, &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dis moi, que tu m&rsquo;aimes&mdash;que tu
m&rsquo;aimes toujours!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je t&rsquo;adore ma belle&mdash;tu es ravissante!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me in your own dear barbarous tongue. Swear
it to me in English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it, my beautiful gipsy. I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me only?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You only;&rdquo; and Eugenia heard him kiss her again
and again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dis done, my Geraldo. You love me more than
the pale-faced miss who scorned you?&rdquo; He laughed a
wild, unpleasant sounding laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? You can love or say you can love.
She was the changeable white moon; you are the
glorious Southern sun. She was ice; you are fire.
Better be burnt to death than die of cold and starvation.
Men have worshipped you&mdash;men have died for
you. I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came into the room. His arm was round her.
Her radiant face rested on his shoulder. Again and
again he kissed those beautiful lips. His eyes were
only for her and saw not Eugenia.</p>

<p>Miss Herbert rose. Her face was as white as her
marble prototype&rsquo;s. She might have passed out unobserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
by Gerald, but Mlle. Carlotta was on the
watch. She pointed to her, and Gerald turned and saw
Eugenia.</p>

<p>He had but time to realize it was no vision&mdash;then
she was gone. With a wild cry he turned to follow
her, but the woman twined her arms around him and
restrained him. She was strong, and for some moments
detained him. Her resistance maddened him. With
a fierce oath he grasped her round arms and tore them
from his neck, throwing her away with such force that
she fell upon the floor. Then he rushed after Eugenia.</p>

<p>She was walking swiftly along the road. He soon
reached her side; but, although aware of his presence,
she neither spoke nor looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>She made no reply&mdash;only walked the faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me why you came?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will never
leave you until you answer me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him. Fresh from that
scene in the studio&mdash;with those words still ringing in
her ears&mdash;even the great change she saw in his face
did not move her to pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;on the eve of my marriage, to
ask forgiveness of a man whom I fancied I had
wronged. I am glad I came. I found him happy,
and in society after his own heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was cold and contemptuous. He quivered
beneath her scorn. At that moment a cab passed.
Eugenia called it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me!&rdquo; she said to Gerald. &ldquo;Leave me! Our
paths in life shall cross no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grasped her wrist. &ldquo;Do you dare to reproach
me? You! Eugenia, I told you it was life or death.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Life or death!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Death, at any
rate, seems made very sweet to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still holding her wrist, he looked into her eyes in a
strange, hopeless way. He saw nothing in them to
help him. He leaned down to her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, death,&rdquo; he said in a solemn whisper; &ldquo;but
the moral and spiritual death comes first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hand left her wrist. He turned, and without a
word strode away. Whither? Even as Tannhauser
returned to the Venusberg, so Gerald Leigh returned
to his studio and Carlotta.</p>

<p>Eugenia wept all the way home. Wept for herself
and Gerald. Wept for the shame she had endured.
Wept for the uselessness of the contemplated atonement.
Wept for the life before her, and for a man&rsquo;s
future and career wrecked by her weakness.</p>

<p>The next week she married Sir Ralph Norgate.
The ceremony was surrounded by befitting splendor.
Yet, even at the alter, Gerald Leigh&rsquo;s pale passionate
face rose before her, and she knew it would never
leave her thoughts. She loved him still!</p>

<p>On her wedding morning she received many letters.
She had no time to read them, so took them with her,
and perused them as she went north with her husband.
Among them was one in a strange handwriting;
it ran thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For your sake he struck me&mdash;Carlotta! But he
came back to me and is mine again. Him I forgive;
not you. We go abroad together to warm, sunny
lands. Some day we shall quarrel and part. Then I
shall remember you and take my revenge. How?
That husband, for whom you deserted Gerald, I shall
take from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugenia&rsquo;s lip curled. She tore the letter and threw
the pieces out of the carriage window.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards Lady Norgate was listlessly
turning the leaves of a society journal. Although she
was a great and fashionable lady she was often listless,
and found life rather a dreary proceeding. She read
to-day, among the theatrical notes, that Mlle. Carlotta,
the divine opera bouffe actress, was engaged to appear
next month at the &ldquo;Frivolity.&rdquo; Although the woman&rsquo;s
absurd threat was unheeded, if not forgotten, her name
recalled too vividly the most painful episode in Lady
Norgate&rsquo;s life. She turned to another part of the
paper and read that the gentleman who committed
suicide under such distressing circumstances, at Monaco,
had now been identified. He was Mr. Gerald
Leigh, the sculptor, whose first important work attracted
so much attention two years ago. It was hinted
that his passion for a well-known actress was the cause
of the rash deed.</p>

<p>Lady Norgate dropped the paper, and covered her
face with her hands. He had spoken truly. Her love
meant life or death!</p>

<p>Had she believed, or troubled about the concluding
paragraph of the notice, had she ventured to tell herself
it was true that Gerald had forgotten her, and
Carlotta was responsible for his death, her mind would
soon have been set at rest.</p>

<p>Like a courteous foe who gives fair warning, Mlle. Carlotta
wrote once more:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is dead. He died for your sake, not mine.
Your name, not mine, was on his lips. Look to yourself.
I am coming to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No doubt Carlotta meant this letter as a first blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
towards revenge. She would hardly have written it
had she known that Lady Norgate would cherish those
words forever. Poor comfort as it was, they told her
that Gerald had loved her to the last.</p>

<p>Then Mlle. Carlotta, more beautiful, more enticing,
more audacious than ever, came to London.</p>

<p>For some months it had been whispered in society
that Sir Ralph Norgate was not so perfect a husband
as such a wife as Eugenia might rightly expect. After
Carlotta&rsquo;s reappearance the whispers grew louder, the
statements more circumstantial. Eugenia caught an
echo of them and smiled disdainfully.</p>

<p>Then the name of Carlotta&rsquo;s new victim became town-talk.
Yet Eugenia made no sign.</p>

<p>Not even when she met her husband, in broad daylight,
seated side by side with the siren. The man had
the grace to turn his head away, but Carlotta shot a
glance of malicious triumph at the pale lady who passed
without a quiver of the lip. James Herbert was with
his sister, and found this encounter too much even for
his cynicism. He was bound to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blackguard!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But Eugenia, I don&rsquo;t
think I would have a divorce or a separation. It
makes such a scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of perfect indifference to me,&rdquo; she
said coldly.</p>

<p>She spoke the truth. Carlotta&rsquo;s romantic vengeance
was an utter failure. Lady Norgate and her husband
were, in truth, no farther apart than they had been for
many months. Eugenia was indifferent.</p>

<p>And, as time goes on, grows more and more so.
Indifferent to wealth, indifferent to rank, to pleasure,
even to pain. She cherishes nothing, cares for nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
save the remembrance that she was once loved by
Gerald Leigh&mdash;that he bade her give him life or death&mdash;that
although she gave him death, he died with her
name on his lips!</p>

<h3>PART I.<br />
<br />
<i class="f9"><b>TOLD BY PHILIP BRAND, M.D., LONDON.</b></i></h3>

<hr class="l4" />

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I wish</span> I had the courage to begin this tale by
turning to my professional visiting books, and, taking
at random any month out of the last twenty years, give
its record as a fair sample of my ordinary work. The
dismal extract would tell you what a doctor&rsquo;s&mdash;I
suppose I may say a successful doctor&rsquo;s&mdash;lot is, when
his practice lies in a poor and densely-populated district
of London. Dreary as such a beginning might be, it
would perhaps allay some of the incredulity which this
tale may probably provoke, as it would plainly show
how little room there is for things imaginative or
romantic in work so hard as mine, or among such
grim realities of poverty, pain, and grief as those by
which I have been surrounded. It would certainly
make it appear extremely unlikely that I should have
found time to imagine, much less to write, a romance
or melodrama.</p>

<p>The truth is that when a man has toiled from nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
o&rsquo;clock in the morning until nine o&rsquo;clock at night,
such leisure as he can enjoy is precious to him,
especially when even that short respite is liable to be
broken in upon at any moment.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of the doleful picture I have drawn of
what may be called &ldquo;the daily grind,&rdquo; I begin this tale
with the account of a holiday.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1864 I turned my back with right
good-will upon London streets, hospitals, and patients,
and took my seat in the North Express. The first
revolution of the wheels sent a thrill of delight through
my jaded frame. A joyful sense of freedom came
over me. I had really got away at last! Moreover,
I had left no address behind me, so for three blessed
weeks might roam an undisputed lord of myself.
Three weeks were not very many to take out of the fifty-two,
but they were all I could venture to give myself;
for even at that time my practice, if not so lucrative as I
could wish, was a large and increasing one. Having
done a twelvemonth&rsquo;s hard work, I felt that no one in
the kingdom could take his holiday with a conscience
clearer than mine, so I lay back in a peculiarly contented
frame of mind, and discounted the coming pleasures of
my brief respite from labor.</p>

<p>There are many ways of passing a holiday&mdash;many
places at which it may be spent; but after all, if you
wish to enjoy it thoroughly there is but one royal rule
to be followed. That is, simply to please yourself&mdash;go
where you like, and mount the innocent holiday hobby
which is dearest to your heart, let its name be botany,
geology, entomology, conchology, venery, piscation, or
what not. Then you will be happy, and return well
braced up for the battle of life. I knew a city clerk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
with literary tastes, who invariably spent his annual
fortnight among the mustiest tomes of the British
Museum, and averred that his health was more benefited
by so doing than if he had passed the time inhaling
the freshest sea-breezes. I dare say he was right
in his assertion.</p>

<p>Sketching has always been my favorite holiday pursuit.
Poor as my drawings may be, nevertheless, as I
turn them over in my portfolio, they bring to me at
least vivid remembrances of many sweet and picturesque
spots, happy days, and congenial companions.
It was not for me to say anything of their actual merits,
but they are dear to me for their associations.</p>

<p>This particular year I went to North Wales, and
made Bettws-y-Coed my headquarters. I stayed at
the Royal Oak, that well-known little inn dear to many
an artist&rsquo;s heart, and teeming with reminiscences of
famous men who have sojourned there times without
number. It was here I made the acquaintance of the
man with whose life the curious events here told are
connected.</p>

<p>On the first day after my arrival at Bettws my appreciation
of my liberty was so thorough, my appetite
for the enjoyment of the beauties of nature so keen
and insatiable, that I went so far and saw so much,
that when I returned to the Royal Oak night had fallen
and the hour of dinner had long passed by. I was,
when my own meal was placed on the table, the only
occupant of the coffee-room. Just then a young man
entered, and ordered something to eat. The waiter
knowing no doubt something of the frank <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</i>
which exists, or should exist, between the followers
of the painter&rsquo;s craft, laid his cover at my table. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
new-comer seated himself, gave me a pleasant smile
and a nod, and in five minutes we were in full swing
of conversation.</p>

<p>The moment my eyes fell upon the young man I
had noticed how singularly handsome he was. Charles
Carriston&mdash;for this I found afterwards to be his name&mdash;was
about twenty-two years of age. He was tall, but
slightly built; his whole bearing and figure being remarkably
elegant and graceful. He looked even more
than gentlemanly,&mdash;he looked distinguished. His face
was pale, its features well-cut, straight, and regular.
His forehead spoke of high intellectual qualities, and
there was somewhat of that development over the eye-brows
which phrenologists, I believe, consider as
evidence of the possession of imagination. The
general expression of his face was one of sadness, and
its refined beauty was heightened by a pair of soft,
dark, dreamy-looking eyes.</p>

<p>It only remains to add that, from his attire, I judged
him to be an artist&mdash;a professional artist&mdash;to the backbone.
In the course of conversation I told him how I
had classified him. He smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only an amateur,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;an idle man,
nothing more&mdash;and you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! I am a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we shall not have to answer to each other
for our sins in painting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked on pleasantly until our bodily wants
were satisfied. Then came that pleasant craving for
tobacco, which after a good meal, is natural to a well-regulated
digestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go and smoke outside?&rdquo; said Carriston.
&ldquo;The night is delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>We went out and sat on one of the wooden benches.
As my new friend said, the night was delicious.
There was scarcely a breath of air moving. The stars
and the moon shone brightly, and the rush of the not
far distant stream came to us with a soothing murmur.
Near us were three or four jovial young artists. They
were in merry mood; one of them had that day sold a
picture to a tourist. We listened to their banter until,
most likely growing thirsty, they re-entered the inn.</p>

<p>Carriston had said little since we had been out of
doors. He smoked his cigar placidly and gazed up at
the skies. With the white moonlight falling on his
strikingly-beautiful face&mdash;the graceful pose into which
he fell&mdash;he seemed to me the embodiment of poetry.
He paid no heed to the merry talk or the artists, which
so much amused me&mdash;indeed, I doubted if he heard
their voices.</p>

<p>Yet he must have done so, for as soon as they had
left us he came out of his reverie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be very nice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have to make
one&rsquo;s living by Art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice for those who can make livings by it,&rdquo; I
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All can do that who are worth it. The day of
neglected genius is gone by. Muller was the last
sufferer, I think&mdash;and he died young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are so sanguine, why not try your own luck
at it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would; but unfortunately I am a rich man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed at this misplaced regret. Then Carriston,
in the most simple way, told me a good deal about
himself. He was an orphan; an only child. He had
already ample means; but fortune had still favors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
store for him. At the death of his uncle, now an aged
man, he must succeed to a large estate and a baronetcy.
The natural, unaffected way in which he made these
confidences, moreover made them not, I knew, from
any wish to increase his importance in my eyes,
greatly impressed me. By the time we parted for the
night I had grown much interested in my new acquaintance&mdash;an
interest not untinged by envy.
Young, handsome, rich, free to come or go, work or
play, as he listed! Happy Carriston!</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> disposed to think that never before did a sincere
friendship, one which was fated to last unbroken
for years, ripen so quickly as that between Carriston
and myself. As I now look back I find it hard to
associate him with any, even a brief, period of time
subsequent to our meeting, during which he was not
my bosom friend. I forget whether our meeting at the
same picturesque spot on the morning which followed
our self-introduction was the result of accident or arrangement.
Anyway, we spent the day together, and
that day was the precursor of many passed in each
other&rsquo;s society. Morning after morning we sallied
forth to do our best to transfer the same bits of scenery
to our sketching-blocks. Evening after evening we
returned to dine side by side, and afterward to talk
and smoke together, indoors or outdoors as the temperature
advised or our wishes inclined.</p>

<p>Great friends we soon became&mdash;inseparable as long
as my short holiday lasted. It was, perhaps, pleasant
for each to work in company with an amateur like
himself. Each could ask the other&rsquo;s opinion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
merits of the work done, and feel happy at the approval
duly given. An artist&rsquo;s standard of excellence
is too high for a non-professional. When he praises
your work he praises it but as the work of an outsider.
You feel that such commendation condemns it and
disheartens you.</p>

<p>However, had Carriston cared to do so, I think he
might have fearlessly submitted his productions to any
conscientious critic. His drawings were immeasurably
more artistic and powerful than mine. He had undoubtedly
great talent, and I was much surprised to
find that good as he was at landscape, he was even better
at the figure. He could, with a firm, bold hand
draw rapidly the most marvellous likenesses. So spirited
and true were some of the studies he showed me,
that I could without flattery advise him, provided he
could finish as he began, to keep entirely to the higher
branch of the art. I have now before me a series of
outline faces drawn by him&mdash;many of them from memory;
and as I look at them the original of each comes
at once before my eyes.</p>

<p>From the very first I had been much interested in
the young man, and as day by day went by, and the
peculiarities of his character were revealed to me, my
interest grew deeper and deeper. I flatter myself that
I am a keen observer and skilful analyst of personal
character, and until now fancied that to write a description
of its component parts was an easy matter. Yet
when I am put to the proof I find it no simple task to
convey in words a proper idea of Charles Carriston&rsquo;s
mental organization.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that he was, I may say, afflicted
by a peculiarly sensitive nature. Although strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and apparently in good health, the very changes of
the weather seemed to affect him almost to the same
extent as they affect a flower. Sweet as his disposition
always was, the tone of his mind, his spirits, his conversation,
varied, as it were, with the atmosphere. He
was full of imagination, and that imagination, always
rich, was at times weird, even grotesquely weird. Not
for one moment did he seem to doubt the stability of
the wild theories he started, or the possibility of the
poetical dreams he dreamed being realized. He had
his faults, of course; he was hasty and impulsive;
indeed to me one of the greatest charms about the boy
was that, right or wrong, each word he spoke came
straight from his heart.</p>

<p>So far as I could judge, the whole organization of
his mind was too highly strung, too finely wrought for
every-day use. A note of joy, of sorrow, even of pity
vibrated through it too strongly for his comfort or
well-being. As yet it had not been called upon to
bear the test of love, and fortunately&mdash;I use the word
advisedly&mdash;fortunately he was not, according to the
usual significance of the word, a religious man, or I
should have thought it not unlikely that some day he
would fall a victim to that religious mania so well
known to my professional brethren, and have developed
hysteria or melancholia. He might even have fancied
himself a messenger sent from heaven for the regeneration
of mankind. From natures like Carriston&rsquo;s are
prophets made.</p>

<p>In short, I may say that my exhaustive study of my
new friend&rsquo;s character resulted in a certain amount of
uneasiness as to his future&mdash;an uneasiness not entirely
free from professional curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the smile came readily and frequently to
his lips, the general bent of his disposition was sad,
even despondent and morbid. And yet few young
men&rsquo;s lives promised to be so pleasant as Charles Carriston&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I was rallying him one day on his future rank and
its responsibilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will, of course, be disgustingly rich?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Carriston sighed. &ldquo;Yes, if I live long enough; but
I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why in the world shouldn&rsquo;t you? You look pale
and thin, but are in capital health. Twelve long miles
we have walked to-day&mdash;you never turned a hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carriston made no reply. He seemed in deep
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friends ought to look after you and get you
a wife,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no friends,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;No nearer relation
than a cousin a good deal older than I am, who
looks upon me as one who was born to rob him of
what should be his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But by the law of primogeniture, so sacred to the
upper ten thousand, he must know you are entitled to
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but for years and years I was always going to
die. My life was not thought worth six months&rsquo; purchase.
All of a sudden I got well. Ever since then
I have seemed, even to myself, a kind of interloper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be unpleasant to have a man longing for
one&rsquo;s death. All the more reason you should marry,
and put other lives between him and the title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy I shall never marry,&rdquo; said Carriston, looking
at me with his soft dark eyes. &ldquo;You see, a boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
who has waited for years expecting to die, doesn&rsquo;t
grow up with exactly the same feelings as other people.
I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever meet a woman I can
care for enough to make my wife. No, I expect my
cousin will be Sir Ralph yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to laugh him out of his morbid ideas.
&ldquo;Those who live will see,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Only promise to
ask me to your wedding, and better still, if you live in
town, appoint me your family doctor. It may prove
the nucleus of that West End practice which it is the
dream of every doctor to establish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the strange beauty of Carriston&rsquo;s
dark eyes. As soon as companionship commenced
between us those eyes became to me, from
scientific reasons, objects of curiosity on account of
the mysterious expression which at times I detected in
them. Often and often they wore a look the like to
which, I imagine, is found only in the eyes of a somnambulist&mdash;a
look which one feels certain is intently
fixed upon something, yet upon something beyond the
range of one&rsquo;s own vision. During the first two or
three days of our new-born intimacy, I found this eccentricity
of Carriston&rsquo;s positively startling. When
now and then I turned to him, and found him staring
with all his might at nothing, my eyes were compelled
to follow the direction in which his own were bent. It
was at first impossible to divest one&rsquo;s self of the belief
that something should be there to justify so fixed a gaze.
However, as the rapid growth of our friendly intercourse
soon showed me that he was a boy of most ardent poetic
temperament&mdash;perhaps even more a poet than an
artist&mdash;I laid at the door of the Muse these absent
looks and recurring flights into vacancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>We were at the Fairy Glen one morning, sketching,
to the best of our ability, the swirling stream, the gray
rocks, and the overhanging trees, the last just growing
brilliant with autumnal tints. So beautiful was everything
around that for a long time I worked, idled, or
dreamed in contented silence. Carriston had set up his
easel at some little distance from mine. At last I
turned to see how his sketch was progressing. He had
evidently fallen into one of his brown studies, and, apparently,
a harder one than usual. His brush had
fallen from his fingers, his features were immovable,
and his strange dark eyes were absolutely riveted upon
a large rock in front of him, at which he gazed as intently
as if his hope of heaven depended upon seeing
through it.</p>

<p>He seemed for the while oblivious to things mundane.
A party of laughing, chattering, terrible tourist girls
scrambled down the rugged steps, and one by one
passed in front of him. Neither their presence nor
the inquisitive glances they cast on his statuesque face
roused him from his fit of abstraction. For a moment
I wondered if the boy took opium or some other narcotic
on the sly. Full of the thought I rose, crossed
over to him, and laid my hand upon his shoulder. As
he felt my touch he came to himself, and looked up at
me in a dazed, inquiring way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Carriston,&rdquo; I said, laughingly, &ldquo;you must
reserve your dreaming fits until we are in places where
tourists do not congregate, or you will be thought a
madman, or at least a poet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no reply. He turned away from me impatiently,
even rudely; then, picking up his brush,
went on with his sketch. After awhile he seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
recover from his pettishness, and we spent the remainder
of the day as pleasantly as usual.</p>

<p>As we trudged home in the twilight, he said to me
in an apologetic, almost penitent way,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I was not rude to you just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you mean?&rdquo; I asked, having almost forgotten
the trivial incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you woke me from what you called my
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no. You were not at all rude. If you
had been, it was but the penalty due to my presumption.
The flight of genius should be respected, not
checked by a material hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is nonsense; I am not a genius, and you must
forgive me for my rudeness,&rdquo; said Carriston simply.</p>

<p>After walking some distance in silence he spoke
again. &ldquo;I wish when you are with me you would try
and stop me from getting into that state. It does me
no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing he was in earnest I promised to do my best,
and was curious enough to ask him whither his
thoughts wandered during those abstracted moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely tell you,&rdquo; he said. Presently he
asked, speaking with hesitation, &ldquo;I suppose you never
feel that under certain circumstances&mdash;circumstances
which you cannot explain&mdash;you might be able to see
things which are invisible to others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see things. What things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things, as I said, which no one else can see. You
must know there are people who possess this power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that certain people have asserted they
possess what they call second-sight; but the assertion
is too absurd to waste time in refuting.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Carriston dreamily, &ldquo;I know that if I
did not strive to avoid it some such power would
come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too ridiculous, Carriston,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Some
people see what others don&rsquo;t because they have longer
sight. You may, of course, imagine anything. But
your eyes&mdash;handsome eyes they are, too&mdash;contain certain
properties, known as humors and lenses, therefore
in order to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; interrupted Carriston; &ldquo;I know exactly
all you are going to say. You, a man of science,
ridicule everything which breaks what you are pleased
to call the law of Nature. Yet take all the unaccountable
tales told. Nine hundred and ninety-nine you
expose to scorn or throw grave doubt upon, yet the
thousandth rests on evidence which cannot be upset
or disputed. The possibility of that one proves the
possibility of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all; but enough for your argument,&rdquo; I
said, amused at the boy&rsquo;s wild talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You doctors,&rdquo; he continued with that delicious air
of superiority so often assumed by laymen when they
are in good health, &ldquo;put too much to the credit of diseased
imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt; it&rsquo;s a convenient shelf on which to put
a difficulty. But go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The body is your province, yet you can&rsquo;t explain
why a cataleptic patient should hear a watch tick when
it is placed against his foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor you; nor any one. But perhaps it may aid
you to get rid of your rubbishing theories if I tell you
that catalepsy, as you understand it, is a disease not
known to us; in fact, it does not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>He seemed crestfallen at hearing this. &ldquo;But what
do you want to prove?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What have you
yourself seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I tell you. And I pray I may never see
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this he seemed inclined to shirk the subject,
but I pinned him to it. I was really anxious to get
at the true state of his mind. In answer to the leading
questions with which I plied him, Carriston revealed
an amount of superstition which seemed utterly
childish and out of place beside the intellectual faculties
which he undoubtedly possessed. So much so,
that at last I felt more inclined to laugh at than to
argue with him.</p>

<p>Yet I was not altogether amused by his talk. His
wild arguments and wilder beliefs made me fancy
there must be a weak spot somewhere in his brain&mdash;even
made me fear lest his end might be madness.
The thought made me sad; for, with the exception of
the eccentricities which I have mentioned, I reckoned
Carriston the pleasantest friend I had ever made. His
amiable nature, his good looks, and perfect breeding
had endeared the young man to me; so much so, that
I resolved, during the remainder of the time we should
spend together, to do all I could toward talking the
nonsense out of him.</p>

<p>My efforts were unavailing. I kept a sharp lookout
upon him, and let him fall into no more mysterious
reveries; but the curious idea that he possessed, or
could possess, some gift above human nature, was too
firmly rooted to be displaced. On all other subjects
he argued fairly and was open to reason. On this one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
point he was immovable. When I could get him to
notice my attacks at all, his answer was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You doctors, clever as you are with the body,
know as little of psychology as you did three thousand
years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the time came for me to fold up my easel
and return to the drudgery of life, I parted from
Carriston with much regret. One of those solemn,
but often broken, promises to join together next year
in another sketching tour passed between us. Then I
went back to London, and during the subsequent
months, although I saw nothing of him, I often
thought of my friend of the autumn.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the spring of 1865 I went down to Bournemouth
to see, for the last time, an old friend who was dying
of consumption. During a great part of the journey
down I had for a travelling companion a well-dressed
gentlemanly man of about forty years of age. We
were alone in the compartment, and after interchanging
some small civilities, such as the barter of newspapers,
slid into conversation. My fellow-traveller
seemed to be an intellectual man, and well posted up
in the doings of the day. He talked fluently and easily
on various topics, and judging by his talk must have
moved in good society. Although I fancied his features
bore traces of hard living and dissipation, he was
not unprepossessing in appearance. The greatest faults
in his face were the remarkable thinness of the lips,
and his eyes being a shade closer together than one
cares to see. With a casual acquaintance such peculiarities
are of little moment, but for my part I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
not choose for a friend one who possessed them without
due trial and searching proof.</p>

<p>At this time the English public were much interested
in an important will case which was then being tried.
The reversion to a vast sum of money depended upon
the testator&rsquo;s sanity or insanity. Like most other people
we duly discussed the matter. I suppose, from
some of my remarks, my companion understood that I
was a doctor. He asked me a good many technical
questions, and I described several curious cases of
mania which had come under my notice. He seemed
greatly interested in the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must sometimes find it hard to say where
sanity ends and insanity begins,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The boundary-line is in some instances hard
to define. To give in such a dubious case an opinion
which would satisfy myself I should want to have
known the patient at the time he was considered quite
sane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To mark the difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And to know the bent of the character.
For instance, there is a friend of mine. He was perfectly
sane when last I saw him, but for all I know he
may have made great progress the other way in the
interval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then without mentioning names, dates, or places, I
described Carriston&rsquo;s peculiar disposition to my intelligent
listener. He heard me with rapt interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You predict he will go mad?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. Unless anything unforeseen arises
he will probably live and die as sane as you or I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you fear for him, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For this reason. I think that any sudden emotion&mdash;violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
grief, for instance&mdash;any unexpected and
crushing blow&mdash;might at once disturb the balance of
his mind. Let his life run on in an even groove, and
all will be well with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My companion was silent for a few moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mention your friend&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>I laughed. &ldquo;Doctors never give names when they
quote cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the next station my companion left the train.
He bade me a polite adieu, and thanked me for the
pleasure my conversation had given him. After wondering
what station in life he occupied I dismissed him
from my mind, as one who had crossed my path for a
short time and would probably never cross it again.</p>

<p>Although I did not see Charles Carriston I received
several letters from him during the course of the year.
He had not forgotten our undertaking to pass my next
holiday together. Early in the autumn, just as I was
beginning to long with a passionate longing for open
air and blue skies, a letter came from Carriston. He
was now, he said, roughing it in the Western Highlands.
He reminded me of last year&rsquo;s promise. Could
I get away from work now? Would I join him? If
I did not care to visit Scotland, would I suggest some
other place where he could join me? Still, the scenery
by which he was now surrounded was superb, and the
accommodation he had secured, if not luxurious, fairly
comfortable. He thought we could not do better. A
postscript to his letter asked me to address him as Cecil
Carr, not Charles Carriston. He had a reason for
changing his name; a foolish reason I should no doubt
call it. When we met he would let me know it.</p>

<p>This letter at once decided me to accept his invitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
In a week&rsquo;s time my arrangements for leave of
absence were complete, and I was speeding northward
in the highest spirits, and well equipped with everything
necessary for my favorite holiday pursuit. I
looked forward with the greatest pleasure to again
meeting Carriston. I found him at Callendar waiting
for me. The coach did not follow the route we were
obliged to take in order to reach the somewhat unfrequented
part of the country in which our tent was
pitched, so my friend had secured the services of a
primitive vehicle and a strong shaggy pony to bear us
the remainder of the journey.</p>

<p>So soon as our first hearty greetings were over I proceeded
to ascertain how the last year had treated
Carriston. I was both delighted and astonished at the
great change for the better which had taken place in
his manner, no less than his appearance. He looked far
more robust; he seemed happier, brighter; although
more like ordinary humanity. Not only had he greeted
me with almost boisterous glee, but during our drive
through the wonderful scenery he was in the gayest of
spirits and full of fun and anecdote. I congratulated
him heartily upon the marked improvement in his
health, both mentally and physically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am much better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I followed a
part of your advice; gave up moping, tried constant
change of scene, interested myself in many more things.
I am quite a different man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No supernatural visitations?&rdquo; I asked, anxious to
learn that his cure in that direction was complete.</p>

<p>His face fell. He hesitated a second before answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I fought against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
strange feeling, and I believe have got rid of it&mdash;at
least I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said no more on the subject. Carriston plunged
into a series of vivid and mimetic descriptions of the
varieties of Scotch character which he had met with
during his stay. He depicted his experiences so
amusingly that I laughed heartily for many a mile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why the change in your name?&rdquo; I asked, when
he paused for a moment in his merry talk.</p>

<p>He blushed, and looked rather ashamed. &ldquo;I scarcely
like to tell you; you will think my reason so absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. I don&rsquo;t judge you by the ordinary
standard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is, my cousin is also in Scotland. I
feared if I gave my true name at the hotel at which I
stayed on my way here, he might perchance see it, and
look me up in these wild regions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and what if he did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. I hate to know I feel like it. But
I have always, perhaps without cause, been afraid of
him; and this place is horribly lonely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that I understood the meaning of his words, I
thought the boy must be joking; but the grave look on
his face showed he was never further from merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Carriston!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you are positively ridiculous
about your cousin. You can&rsquo;t think the man
wants to murder you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I think. I am saying things to
you which I ought not to say; but every time I meet
him I feel he hates me, and wishes me out of the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between wishing and doing there is a great difference.
I dare say all this &rsquo;s fancy on your part.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so. Any way, Cecil Carr is as good a name
up here as Charles Carriston, so please humor my whim
and say no more about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it made no difference to me by what name he
chose to call himself I dropped the subject. I knew
of old that some of his strange prejudices were proof
against anything I could do to remove them.</p>

<p>At last we reached our temporary abode. It was a
substantial, low-built house, owned and inhabited by a
thrifty middle-aged widow, who, although well-to-do so
far as the simple ideas of her neighbors went, was nevertheless
always willing to add to her resources by accommodating
such stray tourists as wished to bury themselves
for a day or two in solitude, or artists who, like
ourselves, preferred to enjoy the beauties of Nature
undisturbed by the usual ebbing and flowing stream of
sightseers.</p>

<p>As Carriston asserted, the accommodation if homely
was good enough for two single men; the fare was
plentiful, and our rooms were the picture of cleanliness.
After a cursory inspection I felt sure that I could
for a few weeks make myself very happy in these
quarters.</p>

<p>I had not been twenty-four hours in the house before
I found out one reason for the great change for
the better in Charles Carriston&rsquo;s demeanor; knew
his step was lighter, his eye brighter, his voice gayer,
and his whole bearing altered. Whether the reason
was a subject of congratulation or not I could not as
yet say.</p>

<p>The boy was in love; in love as only a passionate,
romantic, imaginative nature can be; and even then
only once in a lifetime. Heedless, headstrong, impulsive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and entirely his own master, he had given his very
heart and soul into the keeping of a woman.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> a man of Carriston&rsquo;s rank, breeding and refinement
should meet his fate within the walls of a
lonely farm-house, beyond the Trossachs, seems incredible.
One would scarcely expect to find among such
humble surroundings a wife suitable to a man of his
stamp. And yet when I saw the woman who had won
him I neither wondered at the conquest nor did I blame
him for weakness.</p>

<p>I made the great discovery on the morning after my
arrival. Eager to taste the freshness of the morning
air, I rose betimes and went for a short stroll. I returned,
and whilst standing at the door of the house,
was positively startled by the beauty of a girl who
passed me and entered, as if she was a regular inhabitant
of the place. Not a rosy Scotch lassie, such as one
would expect to find indigenous to the soil; but a slim,
graceful girl, with delicate classical features. A girl
with a mass of knotted light hair, yet with the apparent
anomaly, dark eyes, eyelashes, and eyebrows&mdash;a
combination which, to my mind, makes a style of
beauty rare, irresistible, and dangerous above all others.
The features which filled the exquisite oval of her face
were refined and faultless. Her complexion was pale,
but its pallor in no way suggested anything save perfect
health. To cut my enthusiastic description short,
I may at once say it has never been my good fortune
to cast my eyes on a lovelier creature than this young
girl.</p>

<p>Although her dress was of the plainest and simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
description, no one could have mistaken her for a servant;
and much as I admire the bonny, healthy Scotch
country lassie, I felt sure that mountain air had never
reared a being of this ethereally beautiful type. As
she passed me I raised my hat instinctively. She gracefully
bent her golden head, and bade me a quiet but
unembarrassed good-morning. My eyes followed her
until she vanished at the end of the dark passage which
led to the back of the house.</p>

<p>Even during the brief glimpse I enjoyed of this fair
unknown a strange idea occurred to me. There was a
remarkable likeness between her delicate features and
those, scarcely less delicate, of Carriston. This resemblance
may have added to the interest the girl&rsquo;s appearance
awoke in my mind. Any way I entered our sitting-room,
and, a prey to curiosity, and perhaps, hunger,
awaited with much impatience the appearance of Carriston&mdash;and
breakfast.</p>

<p>The former arrived first. Generally speaking he
was afoot long before I was, but this morning we had
reversed the usual order of things. As soon as I saw
him I cried,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carriston! tell me at once who is the lovely girl I
met outside? An angel with dark eyes and golden
hair. Is she staying here like ourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A look of pleasure flashed into his eyes&mdash;a look
which pretty well told me everything. Nevertheless
he answered as carelessly as if such lovely young
women were as common to the mountain side as rocks
and brambles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you mean Miss Rowan; a niece of our
worthy landlady. She lives with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cannot be Scotch, with such a face and eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Half-and-half. Her father was called an Englishman;
but was, I believe, of French extraction. They
say the name was originally Rohan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carriston seemed to have made close inquiries as to
Miss Rowan&rsquo;s parentage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what brings her here?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has nowhere else to go. Rowan was an artist.
He married a sister of our hostess, and bore her away
from her native land. Some years ago she died, leaving
this one daughter. Last year the father died, penniless,
they tell me, so the girl has since then lived
with her only relative, her aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as you seem to know all about
her, you can introduce me by and by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure, if Miss Rowan permits,&rdquo;
said Carriston. I was glad to hear him give the
conditional promise with as much respect to the lady&rsquo;s
wishes as if she had been a duchess.</p>

<p>Then, with the liberty a close friend may take, I
drew toward me a portfolio, full, I presumed, of
sketches of surrounding scenery. To my surprise
Carriston jumped up hastily and snatched it from me.
&ldquo;They are too bad to look at,&rdquo; he said. As I struggled
to regain possession, sundry strings broke, and, lo and
behold! the floor was littered, not with delineations of
rock, lake, and torrent, but with images of the young
girl I had seen a few minutes before. Full face, profile,
three quarter face, five, even seven eight face, all
were there&mdash;each study perfectly executed by Carriston&rsquo;s
clever pencil. I threw myself into a chair and
laughed aloud, whilst the young man, blushing and
discomforted, quickly huddled the portraits between
the covers, just as a genuine Scotch lassie bore in the
plentiful and, to me, very welcome breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Carriston did favor me with his company during the
whole of that day; but, in spite of my having come
to Scotland to enjoy his society, that day, from easily-guessed
reasons, was the only one in which I had undisputed
possession of my friend.</p>

<p>Of course I bantered him a great deal on the portfolio
episode. He took it in good part, attempting
little or no defence. Indeed, before night he had told
me, with all a boy&rsquo;s fervor, how he had loved Madeline
Rowan at first sight, how in the short space of
time which had elapsed since that meeting he had
wooed her and won her; how good and beautiful she
was; how he worshipped her; how happy he felt;
how, when I went south, he should accompany me;
and, after making a few necessary arrangements, return
at once and bear his bride away.</p>

<p>I could only listen to him, and congratulate him. It
was not my place to act the elder, and advise him
either for or against the marriage. Carriston had only
himself to please, and, if he made a rash step, only
himself to blame for the consequences. And why
should I have dissuaded? I who, in two days, envied
the boy&rsquo;s good fortune.</p>

<p>I saw a great deal of Madeline Rowan. How
strange and out-of-place her name and face seemed
amid our surroundings. If at first somewhat shy and
retiring, she soon, if only for Carriston&rsquo;s sake, consented
to look upon me as a friend, and talked to me
freely and unreservedly. Then I found that her nature
was as sweet as her face. Such a conquest did
she make of me that, save for one chimerical reason, I
should have felt quite certain that Carriston had chosen
well, and would be happy in wedding the girl of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
choice, heedless of her humble position in the world, and
absence of fitting wealth. When once his wife, I felt
sure that if he cared for her to win social success her
looks and bearing would insure it, and from the great
improvement which, as I have already said, I noticed
in his health and spirits, I believed that his marriage
would make his life longer, happier, and better.</p>

<p>Now for my objection, which seems almost a laughable
one. I objected on the score of the extraordinary
resemblance which, so far as a man may resemble a
woman, existed between Charles Carriston and Madeline
Rowan. The more I saw them together, the
more I was struck by it. A stranger might well have
taken them for twin brother and sister. The same
delicate features, drawn in the same lines; the same
soft, dark, dreamy eyes; even the same shaped heads.
Comparing the two, it needed no phrenologist or
physiognomist to tell you that where one excelled the
other excelled; where one failed, the other was wanting.
Now, could I have selected a wife for my friend,
I would have chosen one with habits and constitution
entirely different from his own. She should have been
a bright, bustling woman, with lots of energy and
common-sense&mdash;one who would have rattled him about
and kept him going&mdash;not a lovely, dark-eyed, dreamy
girl, who could for hours at a stretch make herself supremely
happy if only sitting at her lover&rsquo;s feet and
speaking no word. Yet they were a handsome couple,
and never have I seen two people so utterly devoted to
each other as those two seemed to be during those
autumn days which I spent with them.</p>

<p>I soon had a clear proof of the closeness of their
mental resemblance. One evening Carriston, Madeline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and I were sitting out-of-doors, watching the gray
mist deepening in the valley at our feet. Two of the
party were, of course, hand-in-hand, the third seated
at a discreet distance&mdash;not so far away as to preclude
conversation, but far enough off to be able to pretend
that he saw and heard only what was intended for his
eyes and ears.</p>

<p>How certain topics, which I would have avoided
discussing with Carriston, were started I hardly remember.
Probably some strange tale had been passed
down from wilder and even more solitary regions than
ours&mdash;some ridiculous tale of Highland superstition,
no doubt embellished and augmented by each one who
repeated it to his fellows. From her awed talk I soon
found that Madeline Rowan, perhaps by reason of the
Scotch blood in her veins, was as firm a believer in
things visionary and beyond nature as ever Charles
Carriston in his silliest moments could be. As soon as
I could I stopped the talk, and the next day, finding
the girl for a few minutes alone, told her plainly that
subjects of this kind should be kept as far as possible
from her future husband&rsquo;s thoughts. She promised
obedience, with dreamy eyes which looked as far away
and full of visions as Carriston&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;has he ever spoken to you
about seeing strange things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he has hinted at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you believe him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do; he told me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was unanswerable. &ldquo;A pretty pair they will
make,&rdquo; I muttered, as Madeline slipped from me to
welcome her lover who was approaching. &ldquo;They will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
see ghosts in every corner, and goblins behind every
curtain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the young people had no doubts about
their coming bliss. Everything was going smoothly
and pleasantly for them. Carriston had at once spoken
to Madeline&rsquo;s aunt, and obtained the old Scotchwoman&rsquo;s
ready consent to their union. I was rather
vexed at his still keeping to his absurd whim, and concealing
his true name. He said he was afraid of
alarming her aunt by telling her he was passing under
an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i>, whilst if he gave Madeline his true reason
for so doing she would be miserable. Moreover, I
found he had formed the romantic plan of marrying
her without telling her in what an enviable position
she would be placed so far as worldly gear went. A
kind of Lord Burleigh surprise no doubt commended
itself to his imaginative brain.</p>

<p>The last day of my holiday came. I bade a long
and sad farewell to lake and mountain, and, accompanied
by Carriston, started for home. I did not see
the parting proper between the young people&mdash;that
was far too sacred a thing to be intruded upon&mdash;but
even when that protracted affair was over, I waited
many, many minutes whilst Carriston stood hand-in-hand
with Madeline, comforting himself and her by
reiterating &ldquo;Only six weeks&mdash;six short weeks! And
then&mdash;and then!&rdquo; It was the girl who at last tore herself
away, and then Carriston mounted reluctantly by
my side on the rough vehicle.</p>

<p>From Edinburgh we travelled by the night train.
The greater part of the way we had the compartment
to ourselves. Carriston, as a lover will, talked of nothing
but coming bliss and his plans for the future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
After a while I grew quite weary of the monotony of
the subject, and at last dozed off, and for some little
time slept. The shrill whistle which told us a tunnel
was at hand aroused me. My companion was sitting
opposite to me, and as I glanced across at him my
attention was arrested by the same strange intense look
which I had on a previous occasion at Bettws-y-Coed
noticed in his eyes&mdash;the same fixed stare&mdash;the same
obliviousness to all that was passing. Remembering
his request, I shook him, somewhat roughly, back to
his senses. He regarded me for a moment vacantly,
then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I have found out what was wanting to make
the power I told you of complete. I could see her if
I wished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can see her&mdash;in your mind&rsquo;s eye.
All lovers can do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I tried I could see her bodily&mdash;know exactly
what she is doing.&rdquo; He spoke with an air of complete
conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I hope, for the sake of modesty, you won&rsquo;t
try. It is now nearly three o&rsquo;clock. She ought to be
in bed and asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spoke lightly, thinking it better to try and laugh
him out of his folly. He took no notice of my sorry
joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;I am not going to try.
But I know now what was wanting. Love&mdash;such love
as mine&mdash;such love as hers&mdash;makes the connecting link,
and enables sight or some other sense to cross over
space, and pass through every material obstacle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Carriston,&rdquo; I said seriously, &ldquo;you are
talking as a madman talks. I don&rsquo;t want to frighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
you, but I am bound both as a doctor and your sincere
friend to tell you that unless you cure yourself of these
absurd delusions they will grow upon you, develop
fresh forms, and you will probably end your days
under restraint. Ask any doctor, he will tell you the
same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctors are a clever race,&rdquo; answered my strange
young friend, &ldquo;but they don&rsquo;t know everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying he closed his eyes and appeared to sleep.</p>

<p>We parted upon reaching London. Many kind
words and wishes passed between us, and I gave him
some well-meant, and, I believed, needed warnings.
He was going down to see his uncle, the baronet.
Then he had some matters to arrange with his lawyers,
and above all, had to select a residence for himself and
his wife. He would, no doubt, be in London for a short
time. If possible he would come and see me. Any
way he would write and let me know the exact date
of his approaching marriage. If I could manage to
come to it, so much the better. If not he would try,
as they passed through town, to bring his bride to pay
me a flying and friendly visit. He left me in the best
of spirits, and I went back to my patients and worked
hard to make up lost ground, and counteract whatever
errors had been committed by my substitute.</p>

<p>Some six weeks afterward&mdash;late at night&mdash;whilst I
was deep in a new and clever treatise on zymotics, a
man, haggard, wild, unshorn, and unkempt, rushed past
my startled servant, and entered the room in which I
sat. He threw himself into a chair, and I was horrified
to recognize in the intruder my clever and brilliant
friend, Charles Carriston!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> end has come sooner than I expected.&rdquo; These
were the sad words I muttered to myself as waving
my frightened servant away I closed the door, and
stood alone with the supposed maniac. He rose and
wrung my hand, then without a word sank back into
his chair and buried his face in his hands. A sort of
nervous trembling seemed to run through his frame.
Deeply distressed I drew his hands from his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Carriston,&rdquo; I said, as firmly as I could, &ldquo;look
up, and tell me what all this means. Look up, I say,
man, and speak to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to mine, and kept them there,
whilst a ghastly smile&mdash;a phantom humor&mdash;flickered
across his white face. No doubt his native quickness
told him what I suspected, so he looked me full and
steadily in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not as you think. But let there be
no mistake. Question me. Talk to me. Put me to
any test. Satisfy yourself, once for all, that I am as
sane as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke so rationally, his eyes met mine so unflinchingly,
that I was rejoiced to know that my fears were
as yet ungrounded. There was grief, excitement, want
of rest in his appearance, but his general manner told
me he was, as he said, as sane as I was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven you can speak to me and look at me
like this,&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are satisfied then?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this point, yes. Now tell me what is wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that he had set my doubts at rest his agitation
and excitement seemed to return. He grasped my
hand convulsively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeline!&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;Madeline&mdash;my love&mdash;she
is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is gone, I say&mdash;stolen from me by some black-hearted
traitor&mdash;perhaps forever. Who can tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Carriston, surely, in so short a time her love
cannot have been won by another. If so, all I can say
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You have seen her! You
in your wildest dreams to imagine that Madeline Rowan
would leave me of her own free-will! No, sir; she
has been stolen from me&mdash;entrapped&mdash;carried away&mdash;hidden.
But I will find her, or I will kill the black-hearted
villain who has done this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose and paced the room. His face was distorted
with rage. He clinched and unclinched his long slender
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you are talking riddles.
Sit down and tell me calmly what has happened. But,
first of all, as you look utterly worn out, I will ring
for my man to get you some food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want nothing. Weary I am, for
I have been to Scotland and back as fast as man can
travel. I reached London a short time ago, and after
seeing one man have come straight to you, my only
friend, for help&mdash;it may be for protection. But I have
eaten and I have drank, knowing I must keep my
health and strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, I insisted on some wine being brought.
He drank a glass, and then with a strange enforced
calm, told me what had taken place. His tale was
this:</p>

<p>After we had parted company on our return from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Scotland, Carriston went down to the family seat in
Oxfordshire, and informed his uncle of the impending
change in his life. The baronet, an extremely old man,
infirm and all but childish, troubled little about the
matter. Every acre of his large property was strictly
entailed, so his pleasure or displeasure could make but
little alteration in his nephew&rsquo;s prospects. Still, he
was the head of the family, and Carriston was in duty
bound to make the important news known to him. The
young man made no secret of his approaching marriage,
so in a very short time every member of the
family was aware that the heir and future head was
about to ally himself to a nobody. Knowing nothing
of Madeline Rowan&rsquo;s rare beauty and sweet nature
Carriston&rsquo;s kinsmen and kinswomen were sparing with
their congratulations. Indeed, Mr. Ralph Carriston,
the cousin whose name was coupled with such absurd
suspicions, went so far as to write a bitter, sarcastic
letter, full of ironical felicitations. This, and Charles
Carriston&rsquo;s haughty reply, did not make the affection
between the cousins any stronger. Moreover, shortly
afterward the younger man heard that inquiries were
being made in the neighborhood of Madeline&rsquo;s home
as to her position and parentage. Feeling sure that
only his cousin Ralph could have had the curiosity to
institute such inquiries, he wrote and thanked him for
the keen interest he was manifesting in his future welfare,
but begged that hereafter Mr. Carriston would
apply to him direct for any information he wanted.
The two men were now no longer on speaking terms.</p>

<p>Charles Carriston in his present frame of mind cared
little whether his relatives wished to bless or forbid the
banns. He was passionately in love, and at once set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
about making arrangements for a speedy marriage.
Although Madeline was still ignorant of the exalted
position held by her lover&mdash;although she came to him
absolutely penniless&mdash;he was resolved in the matter of
money to treat her as generously as he would have
treated the most eligible damsel in the country. There
were several legal questions to be set at rest concerning
certain property he wished to settle upon her. This
of course caused delay. As soon as they were adjusted
to his own, or rather to his lawyer&rsquo;s satisfaction, he
purposed going to Scotland and carrying away his
beautiful bride. In the meantime he cast about for a
residence.</p>

<p>Somewhat Bohemian in his nature, Carriston had no
intention of settling down just yet to live the life of
an ordinary moneyed Englishman. His intention was
to take Madeline abroad for some months. He had
fixed upon Cannes as a desirable place at which to winter,
but having grown somewhat tired of hotel life,
wished to rent a furnished house. He had received
from an agent to whom he had been advised to apply
the refusal of a house, which, from the glowing
description given, seemed the one above all others he
wanted. As an early decision was insisted upon, my
impulsive young friend thought nothing of crossing
the Channel and running down to the south of France
to see, with his own eyes, that the much-lauded place
was worthy of the fair being who was to be its temporary
mistress.</p>

<p>He wrote to Madeline, and told her he was going
from home for a few days. He said he should be
travelling the greater part of the time, so it should be
no use her writing to him until his return. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
not reveal the object of his journey. Were Madeline
to know it was to choose a winter residence at Cannes
she would be filled with amazement, and the innocent
deception he was still keeping up would not be carried
through to the romantic end which he pictured to
himself.</p>

<p>The day before he started for France Madeline wrote
that her aunt was very unwell, but said nothing as to
her malady causing any alarm. Perhaps Carriston
thought less about the old Scotch widow than her relationship
and kindness to Miss Rowan merited. He
started on his travels without any forebodings of evil.</p>

<p>His journey to Cannes and back was hurried; he
wasted no time on the road, but was delayed for two
days at the place itself before he could make final arrangements
with the owner and the present occupier
of the house. Thinking he was going to start every
moment, he did not write to Madeline&mdash;at the rate at
which he meant to return, a letter posted in England
would reach her almost as quickly as if posted at
Cannes.</p>

<p>He reached his home, which for the last few weeks
had been Oxford, and found two letters waiting for
him. The first, dated on the day he left England, was
from Madeline. It told him that her aunt&rsquo;s illness had
suddenly taken a fatal turn&mdash;that she had died that
day, almost without warning. The second letter was
anonymous.</p>

<p>It was written apparently by a woman, and advised
Mr. Carr to look sharply after his lady-love or he would
find himself left in the lurch. The writer would not
be surprised to hear some fine day that she had eloped
with a certain gentleman who should be nameless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
This precious epistle, probably an emanation of feminine
spite, Carriston treated as it deserved&mdash;he tore it
up and threw the pieces to the wind.</p>

<p>But the thought of Madeline being alone at that
lonely house troubled him greatly. The dead woman
had no sons or daughters; all the anxiety and responsibility
connected with her affairs would fall on the
poor girl. The next day he threw himself into the
Scotch Express and started for her far-away home.</p>

<p>On arriving there he found it occupied only by the
rough farm servants. They seemed in a state of wonderment,
and volubly questioned Carriston as to the
whereabouts of Madeline. The question sent a chill
of fear to his heart. He answered their questions by
others, and soon learned all they had to communicate.</p>

<p>Little enough it was. On the morning after the old
woman&rsquo;s funeral Madeline had gone to Callendar to
ask the advice of an old friend of her aunt&rsquo;s as to
what steps should now be taken. She had neither been
to this friend, nor had she returned home. She had,
however, sent a message that she must go to London
at once, and would write from there. That was the
last heard of her&mdash;all that was known about her.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this news Carriston became a prey to
the acutest terror&mdash;an emotion which was quite inexplicable
to the honest people, his informants. The
girl had gone, but she had sent word whither she had
gone. True, they did not know the reason for her departure,
so sudden and without luggage of any description;
true, she had not written as promised, but no
doubt they would hear from her to-morrow. Carriston
knew better. Without revealing the extent of his
fears he flew back to Callendar. Inquiries at the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
station informed him that she had gone, or had purposed
going, to London; but whether she ever reached
it, or whether any trace of her could be found there,
was at least a matter of doubt. No good could be
gained by remaining in Scotland, so he travelled back
at once to town, half-distracted, sleepless, and racking
his brain to know where to look for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been decoyed away,&rdquo; he said in conclusion.
&ldquo;She is hidden, imprisoned somewhere. And I know,
as well as if he told me, who has done this thing. I
can trace Ralph Carriston&rsquo;s cursed hand through it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at him askance. This morbid suspicion of
his cousin amounted almost to monomania. He had
told the tale of Madeline&rsquo;s disappearance clearly and
tersely; but when he began to account for it his theory
was a wild and untenable one. However much he
suspected Ralph Carriston of longing to stand in his
shoes, I could see no object for the crime of which he
accused him, that of decoying away Madeline Rowan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should he have done this?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;To
prevent your marriage? You are young; he must
have foreseen that you would marry some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carriston leaned toward me, and dropped his voice
to a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is his reason,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this is why I come
to you. You are not the only one who has entirely
misread my nature, and seen a strong tendency to insanity
in it. Of course I know that you are all wrong,
but I know that Ralph Carriston has stolen my love&mdash;stolen
her because he thinks and hopes that her loss
will drive me mad&mdash;perhaps drive me to kill myself.
I went straight to him&mdash;I have just come from him.
Brand, I tell you that when I taxed him with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
crime&mdash;when I raved at him&mdash;when I threatened to
tear the life out of him&mdash;his cold, wicked eyes leaped
with joy. I heard him mutter between his teeth,
&lsquo;Men have been put in strait-waistcoats for less than
this.&rsquo; Then I knew why he had done this. I curbed
myself and left him. Most likely he will try to shut
me up as a lunatic; but I count upon your protection&mdash;count
upon your help to find my love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That any man could be guilty of such a subtle refinement
of crime as that of which he accused his
cousin seemed to me, if not impossible, at least improbable.
But as at present there was no doubt about
my friend&rsquo;s sanity I promised my aid readily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;my dear boy, I won&rsquo;t hear another
word to-night. Nothing can be done until to-morrow;
then we will consult as to what steps should
be taken. Drink this and go to bed; yes, you are as
sane as I am, but, remember, insomnia soon drives the
strongest man out of his senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I poured out an opiate. He drank it obediently.
Before I left him for the night I saw him in bed and
sleeping a heavy sleep.</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advantage to one who writes, not a tale of imagination,
but a simple record of events, is this: He
need not be bound by the recognized canons of the
story-telling art&mdash;need not exercise his ingenuity to
mislead his reader&mdash;need not suppress some things and
lay undue stress on others to create mysteries to be
cleared up at the end of the tale. Therefore, using
the privilege of a plain narrator, I shall here give some
account of what became of Miss Rowan, as, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
I can remember, I heard it some time afterward from
her own lips.</p>

<p>The old Scotchwoman&rsquo;s funeral over, and those
friends who had been present departed, Madeline was
left in the little farm-house alone, save for the presence
of the two servants. Several kind bodies had offered
to come and stay with her, but she had declined the
offers. She was in no mood for company, and perhaps
being of such a different race and breed, would not
have found much comfort in the rough homely sympathy
which was offered to her. She preferred being
alone with her grief&mdash;grief which after all was bound
to be much lightened by the thought of her own approaching
happiness, for the day was drawing near
when her lover would cross the border and bear his
bonny bride away. She felt sure that she would not
be long alone&mdash;that the moment Carriston heard of her
aunt&rsquo;s death he would come to her assistance. In such
a peaceful, God-fearing neighborhood she had no fear
of being left without protection. Moreover, her position
in the house was well-defined. The old woman,
who was childless, had left her niece all of which she
died possessed. So Madeline decided to wait quietly
until she heard from her lover.</p>

<p>Still there were business matters to be attended to,
and at the funeral Mr. Douglas, of Callendar, the executor
under the will, had suggested that an early interview
would be desirable. He offered to drive out
to the little farm the next day, but Miss Rowan, who
had to see to some feminine necessaries which could
only be supplied by shops, decided that she would come
to the town instead of troubling Mr. Douglas to drive
so far out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Madeline, in spite of the superstitious element in
her character, was a brave girl, and in spite of her refined
style of beauty, strong and healthy. Early hours
were the rule in that humble home, so before seven
o&rsquo;clock in the morning she was ready to start on her
drive to the little town. At first she thought of taking
with her the boy who did the rough out-door work;
but he was busy about something or other, and besides,
was a garrulous lad who would be certain to chatter
the whole way, and this morning Miss Rowan wanted
no companions save her own mingled thoughts of sadness
and joy. She knew every inch of the road; she
feared no evil; she would be home again long before
nightfall; the pony was quiet and sure-footed&mdash;so
away went Madeline in the strong primitive vehicle
on her lonely twelve miles&rsquo; drive through the fair
scenery.</p>

<p>She passed few people on the road. Indeed, she remembered
meeting no one except one or two pedestrian
tourists, who like sensible men were doing a portion of
their day&rsquo;s task in the early morning. I have no doubt
but Miss Rowan seemed to them a passing vision of
loveliness.</p>

<p>But when she was a mile or two from Callendar, she
saw a boy on a pony. The boy, who must have known
her by sight, stopped and handed her a telegram. She
had to pay several shillings for the delivery, or intended
delivery of the message, so far from the station.
The boy galloped away, congratulating himself on
having been spared a long ride, and Miss Rowan tore
open the envelope left in her hands.</p>

<p>The message was brief: &ldquo;Mr. Carr is seriously ill.
Come at once. You will be met in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Madeline did not scream or faint. She gave one low
moan of pain, set her teeth, and with the face of one
in a dream drove as quickly as she could to Callendar,
straight to the railway station.</p>

<p>Fortunately, or rather unfortunately, she had money
with her, so she did not waste time in going to Mr.
Douglas. In spite of the crushing blow she had received
the girl had all her wits about her. A train
would start in ten minutes&rsquo; time. She took her ticket,
then found an idler outside the station, and paid him
to take the pony and carriage back to the farm, with
the message as repeated to Carriston.</p>

<p>The journey passed like a long dream. The girl
could think of nothing but her lover, dying, dying&mdash;perhaps
dead before she could reach him. The miles
flew by unnoticed; twilight crept on; the carriage
grew dark; at last&mdash;London at last! Miss Rowan
stepped out on the broad platform, not knowing what
to do or where to turn. Presently a tall well-dressed
man came up to her, and removing his hat, addressed
her by name. The promise as to her being met had
been kept.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands. &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;oh tell me, he
is not dead,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carr is not dead. He is ill, very ill&mdash;delirious
and calling for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he? Oh take me to him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is miles and miles from here&mdash;at a friend&rsquo;s
house. I have been deputed to meet you and to accompany
you, if you feel strong enough to continue the
journey at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;Take me to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your luggage?&rdquo; asked the gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have none. Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take some refreshment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need nothing. Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman glanced at his watch. &ldquo;There is
just time,&rdquo; he said. He called a cab, told the driver
to go at top speed. They reached Paddington just in
time to catch the mail.</p>

<p>During the drive across London Madeline asked
many questions, and learned from her companion that
Mr. Carr had been staying for a day or two at a friend&rsquo;s
house in the west of England. That yesterday he
had fallen from his horse and sustained such injuries
that his life was despaired of. He had been continually
calling for Madeline. They had found her address
on a letter, and had telegraphed as soon as possible&mdash;for
which act Miss Rowan thanked her companion
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>Her conductor did not say much of his own accord,
but in replying to her questions he was politely sympathetic.
She thought of little outside the fearful
picture which filled every corner of her brain, but
from her conductor&rsquo;s manner received the impression
that he was a medical adviser who had seen the
sufferer, and assisted in the treatment of the case.
She did not ask his name, nor did he reveal it.</p>

<p>At Paddington he placed her in a ladies&rsquo; carriage
and left her.</p>

<p>He was a smoker, he said. She wondered somewhat
at this desertion. Then the train sped down West.
At the large stations the gentleman came to her and
offered her refreshments. Hunger seemed to have
left her; but she accepted a cup of tea once or twice.
At last sorrow, fatigue, and weakness produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
such a prolonged fast had their natural effect. With
the tears still on her lashes the girl fell asleep, and
must have slept for many miles: a sleep unbroken by
stoppages at stations.</p>

<p>Her conductor at last aroused her. He stood at the
door of the carriage. &ldquo;We must get out here,&rdquo; he
said. All the momentarily-forgotten anguish came
back to her as she stood beside him on the almost unoccupied
platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we there at last?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say we have still a long drive; would
you like to rest first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no. Come on, if you please.&rdquo; She spoke
with feverish eagerness.</p>

<p>The man bowed. &ldquo;A carriage waits,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Outside the station was a carriage of some sort,
drawn by one horse, and driven by a man muffled up
to the eyes. It was still night, but Madeline fancied
dawn could not be far off. Her conductor opened the
door of the carriage and waited for her to enter.</p>

<p>She paused. &ldquo;Ask him&mdash;that man must know
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am most remiss,&rdquo; said the gentleman. He exchanged
a few words with the driver, and coming
back, told Madeline that Mr. Carr was still alive, sensible,
and expecting her eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, please drive fast,&rdquo; said the poor girl,
springing into the carriage. The gentleman seated
himself beside her, and for a long time they drove on
in silence. At last they stopped. The dawn was just
glimmering. They alighted in front of a house. The
door was open. Madeline entered swiftly. &ldquo;Which
way&mdash;which way?&rdquo; she asked. She was too agitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to notice any surroundings; her one wish was to reach
her lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; said the conductor, passing her.
&ldquo;This way; please follow me.&rdquo; He went up a short
flight of stairs, then paused, and opened a door quietly.
He stood aside for the girl to enter. The room was
dimly lit, and contained a bed with drawn curtains.
Madeline flew past her travelling companion, and as
she threw herself on her knees beside the bed upon
which she expected to see the helpless and shattered
form of the man she loved, heard, or fancied she
heard, the door locked behind her.</p>


<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Carriston</span> slept on late into the next day. Knowing
that every moment of bodily and mental rest was
a precious boon to him, I left him undisturbed. He
was still fast asleep when, about mid-day, a gentleman
called upon me. He sent up no card, and I supposed
he came to consult me professionally.</p>

<p>The moment he entered my room I recognized him.
He was the thin-lipped, gentlemanly person whom I
had met on my journey to Bournemouth last spring&mdash;the
man who had seemed so much impressed by my
views on insanity, and had manifested such interest in
the description I had given&mdash;without mentioning any
name&mdash;of Carriston&rsquo;s peculiar mind.</p>

<p>I should have at once claimed acquaintanceship with
my visitor, but before I could speak he advanced, and
apologized gracefully for his intrusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will forgive it,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;when I tell you
my name is Ralph Carriston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Remembering our chance conversation, the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that, after all, Charles Carriston&rsquo;s wild suspicion was
well-founded, flashed through me like lightning. My
great hope was that my visitor might not remember
my face as I remembered his. I bowed coldly but
said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe, Dr. Brand,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you have a
young relative of mine at present staying with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Carriston is my guest,&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;We are old friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I did not know that. I do not remember
having heard him mention your name as a friend.
But as it is so, no one knows better than you do the
unfortunate state of his health. How do you find him
to-day&mdash;violent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pretended to ignore the man&rsquo;s meaning, and answered
smilingly, &ldquo;Violence is the last thing I should
look for. He is tired out and exhausted by travel,
and is in great distress. That, I believe, is the whole
of his complaint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; to be sure, poor boy! His sweetheart has
left him, or something. But as a doctor you must
know that his mental condition is not quite what it
should be. His friends are very anxious about him.
They fear that a little restraint&mdash;temporary, I hope&mdash;must
be put upon his actions. I called to ask your advice
and aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what, Mr. Carriston?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this. A young man can&rsquo;t be left free to go
about threatening his friends&rsquo; lives. I have brought
Dr. Daley with me; you know him, of course. He is
below in my carriage. I will call him up, with your
permission. He could then see poor Charles, and the
needful certificate could be signed by you two doctors.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carriston,&rdquo; I said decidedly, &ldquo;let me tell you
in the plainest words that your cousin is at present as
fully in possession of his wits as you are. Dr. Daley,
whoever he may be, could sign no certificate, and in
our day no asylum would dare to keep Mr. Carriston
within its walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An unpleasant sinister look crossed my listener&rsquo;s
face, but his voice still remained bland and suave. &ldquo;I
am sorry to differ from you, Dr. Brand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
I know him better than you do. I have seen him as
you have never yet seen him. Only last night he
came to me in a frantic state. I expected every moment
he would make a murderous attack on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he fancied he had some reasons for anger,&rdquo;
I said.</p>

<p>Ralph Carriston looked at me with those cold eyes
of which his cousin had spoken. &ldquo;If the boy has
succeeded in converting you to any of his delusions I
can only say that doctors are more credulous than I
fancied. But the question is not worth arguing. You
decline to assist me, so I must do without you. Good-morning,
Dr. Brand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left the room as gracefully as he had entered it.
I remained in a state of doubt. It was curious that
Ralph Carriston turned out to be the man whom I had
met in the train; but the evidence offered by the
coincidence was not enough to convict him of the
crime of endeavoring to drive his cousin mad by
such a far-fetched stratagem as the inveigling away
of Madeline Rowan. Besides, even in wishing to
prove Charles Carriston mad he had much to say on
his side. Supposing him to be innocent of having abducted
Madeline, Carriston&rsquo;s violent behavior on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
preceding evening must have seemed very much like
insanity. In spite of the aversion with which Ralph
Carriston inspired me, I scarcely knew which side to
believe.</p>

<p>Carriston still slept; so when I went out on my afternoon
rounds I left a note, begging him to remain in
the house until my return. Then I found him up,
dressed, and looking much more like himself. When
I entered, dinner was on the table; so not until that
meal was over could we talk unrestrainedly upon the
subject which was uppermost in both our minds.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone I turned toward my guest.
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we must settle what to do.
There seems to me to be but one course open. You
have plenty of money, so your best plan is to engage
skilled police assistance. Young ladies can&rsquo;t be spirited
away like this without leaving a trace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my surprise Carriston flatly objected to this
course. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall not go to the police.
The man who took her away has placed her where no
police can find her. I must find her myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find her yourself! Why, it may be months, years,
before you do that! Good heavens, Carriston! She
may be murdered, or worse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall know if any further evil happens to her&mdash;then
I shall kill Ralph Carriston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you tell me you have no clew whatever to
trace her by. Do talk plainly. Tell me all or
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carriston smiled very faintly. &ldquo;No clew that you,
at any rate, will believe in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I know
this much, she is a prisoner somewhere. She is unhappy,
but not, as yet, ill-treated. Heavens! do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
think if I did not know this I should keep my senses
for an hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you possibly know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By that gift&mdash;that extra sense or whatever it is&mdash;which
you deride. I knew it would come to me some
day, but I little thought how I should welcome it. I
know that in some way I shall find her by it. I tell
you I have already seen her three times. I may see
her again at any moment when the strange fit comes
over me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this fantastic nonsense was spoken so simply and
with such an air of conviction that once more my suspicions
as to the state of his mind were aroused. In
spite of the brave answers which I had given Mr.
Ralph Carriston, I felt that common-sense was undeniably
on his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you mean by your strange fit,&rdquo; I
said, resolved to find out the nature of Carriston&rsquo;s fancies
or hallucinations. &ldquo;Is it a kind of trance you fall
into?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed loath to give any information on the
subject, but I pressed him for an answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;It must be a kind of
trance. An indescribable feeling comes over me. I
know that my eyes are fixed on some object&mdash;presently
that object vanishes, and I see Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems to stand in a blurred circle of light as
cast by a magic lantern. That is the only way that I can
describe it. But her figure is plain and clear&mdash;she
might be close to me. The carpet on which she stands
I can see, the chair on which she sits, the table on
which she leans her hand, anything she touches I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
see; but no more. I have seen her talking. I knew
she was entreating some one, but that some one was
invisible. Yet, if she touched that person, the virtue
of her touch would enable me to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far as I could see, Carriston&rsquo;s case appeared to be
one of over-wrought, or unduly-stimulated imagination.
His I had always considered to be a mind of
the most peculiar construction. In his present state of
love, grief, and suspense these hallucinations might
come in the same way in which dreams come. For a
little while I sat in silence, considering how I could
best combat with and dispel his remarkable delusions.
Before I had arrived at any decision I was called away
to see a patient. I was but a short time engaged.
Then I returned to Carriston, intending to continue
my inquiries.</p>

<p>Upon re-entering the room I found him sitting, as I
had left him&mdash;directly opposite to the door. His face
was turned fully toward me, and I trembled as I caught
sight of it. He was leaning forward; his hands on
the table-cloth, his whole frame rigid, his eyes staring
in one direction, yet, I knew, capable of seeing
nothing that I could see. He seemed even oblivious
to sound, for I entered the room and closed the door
behind me without causing him to change look or position.
The moment I saw the man I knew that he had
been overtaken by what he called the strange fit.</p>

<p>My first impulse&mdash;a natural one&mdash;was to arouse him;
but second thoughts told me that this was an opportunity
for studying his disease which should not be lost&mdash;I
felt that I could call it by no other name than
disease&mdash;so I proceeded to make a systematic examination
of his symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>I leaned across the table; and, with my face about a
foot from his, looked straight into his eyes. They betrayed
no sign of recognition&mdash;no knowledge of my
presence. I am ashamed to say I could not divest myself
of the impression that they were looking through
me. The pupils were greatly dilated. The lids were
wide apart. I lighted a taper and held it before them,
but could see no expansion of the iris. It was a case,
I confess, entirely beyond my comprehension. I had
no experience which might serve as a guide as to what
was the best course to adopt. All I could do was to
stand and watch carefully for any change.</p>

<p>Save for his regular breathing and a sort of convulsive
twitching of his fingers, Carriston might have
been a corpse or a statue. His face could scarcely
grow paler than it had been before the attack. Altogether,
it was an uncomfortable sight: a creepy sight&mdash;this
motionless man, utterly regardless of all that
went on around him, and seeing, or giving one the
idea that he saw something far away. I sighed as I
looked at the strange spectacle, and foresaw what the
end must surely be. But although I longed for him to
awake, I determined on this occasion to let the trance,
or fit, run its full course, that I might notice in what
manner and how soon consciousness returned.</p>

<p>I must have waited and watched some ten minutes&mdash;minutes
which seemed to me interminable. At last
I saw the lips quiver, the lids flicker once or twice, and
eventually close wearily over the eyes. The unnatural
tension of every muscle seemed to relax, and, sighing
deeply, and apparently quite exhausted, Carriston
sank back into his chair with beads of perspiration
forming on his white brow. The fit was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment I was at his side and forcing a glass of
wine down his throat. He looked up at me and spoke.
His voice was faint, but his words were quite collected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen her again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is well;
but so unhappy. I saw her kneel down and pray.
She stretched her beautiful arms out to me. And yet
I know not where to look for her&mdash;my poor love! my
poor love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I waited until I thought he had sufficiently recovered
from his exhaustion to talk without injurious consequences.
&ldquo;Carriston,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let me ask you one
question: Are these trances or visions voluntary or
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reflected for a few moments. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite
tell you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;or, rather, I would put in this
way. I do not think I can exercise my power at will;
but I can feel when the fit is coming on me, and, I believe,
can if I choose stop myself from yielding to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Now listen. Promise me you will
fight against these seizures as much as you can. If
you don&rsquo;t you will be raving mad in a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise that,&rdquo; said Carriston, quietly.
&ldquo;See her at times I must, or I shall die. But I
promise to yield as seldom as may be. I know, as well
as you do, that the very exhaustion I now feel must be
injurious to any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In truth, he looked utterly worn out. Very much
dissatisfied with his concession, the best I could get
from him, I sent him to bed, knowing that natural
rest, if he could get it, would do more than anything
else toward restoring a healthy tone to his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>


<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Carriston stated that he came to me for
aid, and, it may be, for protection, he manifested the
greatest reluctance in following any advice I offered
him. The obstinacy of his refusal to obtain the
assistance of the police placed me in a predicament.
That Madeline Rowan had really disappeared I was, of
course, compelled to believe. It might even be possible
that she was kept against her will in some place of
concealment. In such a case it behooved us to take
proper steps to trace her. Her welfare should not
depend upon the hallucinations and eccentric ideas of
a man half out of his senses with love and grief. I
all but resolved, even at the risk of forfeiting Carriston&rsquo;s
friendship, to put the whole matter in the hands
of the police, unless in the course of a day or two we
heard from the girl herself, or Carriston suggested
some better plan.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, although refusing to be guided by
me, he made no suggestion on his own account. He
was racked by fear and suspense, yet his only idea of
solving difficulties seemed to be that of waiting. He
did nothing. He simply waited, as if he expected that
chance would bring what he should have been searching
for high and low.</p>

<p>Some days passed before I could get a tardy consent
that aid should be sought. Even then he would not go
to the proper quarter; but he allowed me to summon
to our councils a man who advertised himself as being
a private detective. This man, or one of his men,
came at our call, and heard what was wanted of him.
Carriston reluctantly gave him one of Madeline&rsquo;s photographs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
He also told him that only by watching and
spying on Ralph Carriston&rsquo;s every action could he hope
to obtain the clew. I did not much like the course
adopted, nor did I like the look of the man to whom
the inquiry was intrusted; but at any rate something
was being done.</p>

<p>A week passed without any news from our agent.
Carriston, in truth, did not seem to expect any. I believe
he only employed the man in deference to my
wishes. He moved about the house in a disconsolate
fashion. I had not told him of my interview with his
cousin, but had cautioned him on the rare occasions
upon which he went out of doors to avoid speaking to
strangers, and my servants had strict instructions to
prevent any one coming in and taking my guest by
surprise.</p>

<p>For I had during those days opened a confidential
inquiry on my own account. I wanted to learn
something about this Mr. Ralph Carriston. So I asked
a man who knew everybody to find out all about him.</p>

<p>He reported that Ralph Carriston was a man well
known about London. He was married and had a
house in Dorsetshire; but the greater part of his time
was spent in town. Once he was supposed to be well-off;
but now it was the general opinion that every acre
he owned was mortgaged, and that he was much pressed
for money. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; my informant said, &ldquo;there is but
one life between him and the reversion to large estates,
and that life is a poor one. I believe even now there
is talk about the man who stands in his way being mad.
If so, Ralph Carriston will get the management of
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this news I felt it more than ever needful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
keep a watchful eye on my friend. So far as I knew
there had been no recurrence of the trance, and I began
to hope that proper treatment would effect a complete
cure, when, to my great alarm and annoyance,
Carriston, while sitting with me, suddenly and without
warning fell into the same strange state of body and
mind as previously described. This time he was sitting
in another part of the room. After watching
him for a minute or two, and just as I was making up
my mind to arouse him and scold him thoroughly for
his folly, he sprung to his feet, and shouting, &ldquo;Let her
go! Loose her, I say!&rdquo; rushed violently across the
room&mdash;so violently, that I had barely time to interpose
and prevent him from coming into contact with the
opposite wall.</p>

<p>Upon returning to his senses he told me, with great
excitement, that he had again seen Madeline; moreover,
this time he had seen a man with her&mdash;a man
who had placed his hand upon her wrist and kept it
there; and so, according to Carriston&rsquo;s wild reasoning,
became, on account of the contact, visible to him.</p>

<p>He told me he had watched them for some moments,
until the man, tightening his grip on the girl&rsquo;s arm,
endeavored, he thought, to lead her or induce her to
follow him somewhere. At this juncture, unaware that
he was gazing at a vision, he had rushed to her assistance
in the frantic way I have described&mdash;then he
awoke.</p>

<p>He also told me he had studied the man&rsquo;s features
and general appearance most carefully with a view to
future recognition. All these ridiculous statements
were made as he made the former ones, with the air of
one relating simple, undeniable facts&mdash;one speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the plain, unvarnished truth, and expecting full credence
to be given to his words.</p>

<p>It was too absurd! too sad! It was evident to me
that the barrier between his hallucinations, dreams,
visions, or what he chose to call them, and pure insanity,
was now a very slight and fragile one. But before
I gave up his case as hopeless I determined to
make another strong appeal to his common-sense. I
told him of his cousin&rsquo;s visit to me&mdash;of his intentions
and proposition. I begged him to consider what consequences
his extraordinary beliefs and extravagant
actions must eventually entail. He listened attentively
and calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how right I was in attributing
all this to Ralph Carriston&mdash;how right I was to
come to you, a doctor of standing, who can vouch for
my sanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vouch for your sanity! How can I when you sit
here and talk such arrant nonsense, and expect me to
believe it? When you jump from your chair and rush
madly at some visionary foe? Sane as you may be in
all else, any evidence I could give in your favor must
break down in cross-examination if an inkling of these
things got about. Come, Carriston, be reasonable, and
prove your sanity by setting about this search for Miss
Rowan in a proper way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no reply, but walked up and down the
room apparently in deep thought. My words seemed
to have had no effect upon him. Presently he seated
himself; and, as if to avoid returning to the argument,
drew a book at hazard from my shelves and began to
read. He opened the volume at random, but after
reading a few lines seemed struck by something that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
met his eyes, and in a few minutes was deeply immersed
in the contents of the book. I glanced at
it to see what had so awakened his interest. By a
curious fatality he had chosen a book the very worst
for him in his present frame of mind&mdash;Gilchrist&rsquo;s recently
published life of William Blake, that masterly
memoir of a man who was on certain points as mad as
Carriston himself. I was about to remonstrate, when
he laid down the volume and turned to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Varley, the painter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was a firm believer
in Blake&rsquo;s visions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Varley was a bigger fool than Blake,&rdquo; I retorted.
&ldquo;Fancy his sitting down and watching his clever but
mad friend draw spectral heads, and believing them to
be genuine portraits of dead kings whose forms condescended
to appear to Blake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden thought seemed to strike Carriston.
&ldquo;Will you give me some paper and chalk?&rdquo; he asked.
Upon being furnished with these materials he seated
himself at the table and began to draw. At least a
dozen times he sketched, with his usual rapidity, some
object or another, and a dozen times, after a moment&rsquo;s
consideration, threw each sketch aside with an air of
disappointment and began a fresh one. At last one of
his attempts seemed to come up to his requirements.
&ldquo;I have it now, exactly!&rdquo; he cried with joy&mdash;even
triumph&mdash;in his voice. He spent some time in putting
finishing touches to the successful sketch, then he
handed me the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the man I saw just now with Madeline,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;When I find him I shall find her.&rdquo; He spoke
with all sincerity and conviction. I looked at the paper
with, I am bound to say, a great amount of curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>No matter from what visionary source Carriston had
drawn his inspiration, his sketch was vigorous and natural
enough. I have already mentioned his wonderful
power of drawing portraits from memory, so was willing
to grant that he might have reproduced the outline
of some face which had somewhere struck him. Yet
why should it have been this one? His drawing represented
the three quarter face of a man&mdash;an ordinary man&mdash;apparently
between forty and fifty years of age. It
was a coarse-featured, ill-favored face, with a ragged
ruff of hair round the chin. It was not the face of a
gentleman, nor even the face of a gentle-nurtured man;
and the artist, by a few cunning strokes, had made it
wear a crafty and sullen look. The sketch, as I write
this, lies before me, so that I am not speaking from
memory.</p>

<p>Now, there are some portraits of which, without
having seen the original, we say, &ldquo;What splendid likenesses
these must be.&rdquo; It was so with Carriston&rsquo;s
sketch. Looking at it you felt sure it was exactly like
the man whom it was intended to represent. So that,
with the certain amount of art knowledge which I am
at least supposed to possess, it was hard for me, after
examining the drawing and recognizing the true artist&rsquo;s
touch in every line, to bring myself to accept the fact
that it was but the outcome of a diseased imagination.
As, at this very moment, I glance at that drawing, I
scarcely blame myself for the question that faintly
frames itself in my innermost heart. &ldquo;Could it be
possible&mdash;could there be in certain organizations powers
not yet known&mdash;not yet properly investigated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My thought, supposing such a thought was ever
there&mdash;was not discouraged by Carriston, who, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
as if his faith in the bodily existence of the man whose
portrait lay in my hand was unassailable, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I noticed that his general appearance was that of a
countryman&mdash;an English peasant; so in the country I
shall find my love. Moreover, it will be easy to identify
the man, as the top joint is missing from the
middle finger of his right hand. As it lay on Madeline&rsquo;s
arm I noticed that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I argued with him no more. I felt that words
would be but wasted.</p>


<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A day</span> or two after I had witnessed what I must
call Carriston&rsquo;s second seizure we were favored with a
visit from the man whose services we had secured to
trace Madeline. Since he had received his instructions
we had heard nothing of his proceeding until he now
called to report progress in person. Carriston had
not expressed the slightest curiosity as to where the
man was or what he was about. Probably he looked
upon the employment of this private detective as nothing
more useful than a salve to my conscience. That
Madeline was only to be found through the power
which he professed to hold of seeing her in his visions
was, I felt certain, becoming a rooted belief of his.
Whenever I expressed my surprise that our agent
had brought or sent no information, Carriston shrugged
his shoulders, and assured me that from the first
he knew the man&rsquo;s researches would be fruitless.
However, the fellow had called at last, and, I hoped,
had brought us good news.</p>

<p>He was a glib-tongued man, who spoke in a confident,
matter-of-fact way. When he saw us he rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
his hands as one who had brought affairs to a successful
issue, and now meant to reap praise and other rewards.
His whole bearing told me he had made an important
discovery; so I begged him to be seated, and give us
his news.</p>

<p>Carriston gave him a careless glance, and stood at
some little distance from us. He looked as if he
thought the impending communication scarcely worth
the trouble of listening to. He might, indeed, from
his looks, have been the most disinterested person of
the three. He even left me to do the questioning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Mr. Sharpe,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let us hear if
you have earned your money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, sir,&rdquo; replied Sharpe, looking curiously
at Carriston, who, strange to say, heard this answer
with supreme indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I may say I have, sir,&rdquo; continued the detective&mdash;&ldquo;that
is if the gentlemen can identify these
articles as being the young lady&rsquo;s property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he produced from a thick letter-case a
ribbon in which was stuck a silver pin, mounted with
Scotch pebbles, an ornament that I remembered having
seen Madeline wear. Mr. Sharpe handed them to Carriston.
He examined them, and I saw his cheeks flush
and his eyes grow bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come by this?&rdquo; he cried, pointing to
the silver ornament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you presently, sir. Do you recognize it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave it to Miss Rowan myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we are on the right track,&rdquo; I cried, joyfully.
&ldquo;Go on, Mr. Sharpe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, gentlemen, we are certainly on the right track;
but after all, it isn&rsquo;t my fault if the track don&rsquo;t lead exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
where you wish. You see, when I heard of this
mysterious disappearance of the lady, I began to concoct
my own theory. I said to myself, when a young
and beautiful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound your theories!&rdquo; cried Carriston fiercely.
&ldquo;Go on with your tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man gave his interrupter a spiteful glance.
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as you gave me strict instructions
to watch a certain gentleman closely, I obeyed
those instructions, of course, although I knew I was on
a fool&rsquo;s errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go on?&rdquo; cried Carriston. &ldquo;If you know
where Miss Rowan is, say so; your money will be
paid you the moment I find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I exactly know where to find the lady,
but I can soon know if you wish me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell your tale your own way, but as shortly as
possible,&rdquo; I said, seeing that my excitable friend was
preparing for another outburst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found there was nothing to be gained by keeping
watch on the gentleman you mentioned, sir, so I went
to Scotland and tried back from there. As soon as I
worked on my own lay I found out all about it. The
lady went from Callendar to Edinburgh, from Edinburgh
to London, from London to Folkestone, and
from Folkestone to Boulong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at Carriston. All his calmness seemed to
have returned. He was leaning against the mantelpiece,
and appeared quite unmoved by Mr. Sharpe&rsquo;s
clear statement as to the route Madeline had taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued Mr. Sharpe, &ldquo;I was not
quite certain I was tracking the right person, although
her description corresponded with the likeness you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
gave me. But as you are sure this article of jewelry
belonged to the lady you want, the matter is beyond a
doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I said, seeing that Carriston had no
intention of speaking. &ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was left behind, in a bedroom of one of the
principal hotels in Folkestone. I did go over to
Boulong, but after that I thought I had learned all
you would care to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something in the man&rsquo;s manner which
made me dread what was coming. Again I looked at
Carriston. His lips were curved with contempt, but
he still kept silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not have pursued your inquiries past Boulong?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For this reason, sir. I had learned enough. The
theory I had concocted was the right one after all. The
lady went to Edinburgh alone, right enough: but she
didn&rsquo;t leave Edinburgh alone, nor she didn&rsquo;t leave
London alone, nor she didn&rsquo;t stay at Folkestone&mdash;where
I found the pin&mdash;alone, nor she didn&rsquo;t go to
Boulong alone. She was accompanied by a young
gentleman who called himself Mr. Smith; and what&rsquo;s
more, she called herself Mrs. Smith. Perhaps she
was; as they lived like man and wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether the fellow was right or mistaken, this explanation
of Madeline&rsquo;s disappearance seemed to give
me what I can only compare to a smack in the face. I
stared at the speaker in speechless astonishment. If
the tale he told so glibly and circumstantially was true,
farewell, so far as I was concerned, to belief in the love
or purity of women. Madeline Rowan, that creature
of a poet&rsquo;s dream, on the eve of her marriage with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Charles Carriston to fly, whether wed or unwed mattered
little, with another man! And yet, she was but
a woman. Carriston&mdash;or Carr, as she only knew him&mdash;was
in her eyes poor. The companion of her flight
might have won her with gold. Such things have
been. Still&mdash;</p>

<p>My rapid and wrongful meditations were cut short
in an unexpected way. Suddenly I saw Mr. Sharpe
dragged bodily out of his chair and thrown on the
floor, while Carriston, standing over him, thrashed the
man vigorously with his own ash stick&mdash;a convenient
weapon, so convenient that I felt Mr. Sharpe could not
have selected a stick more appropriate for his own
chastisement. So Carriston seemed to think, for he
laid on cheerfully some eight or ten good cutting
strokes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, being a respectable doctor and a man
of peace, I was compelled to interfere. I held Carriston&rsquo;s
arm while Mr. Sharpe struggled to his feet, and
after collecting his hat and his pocket-book, stood
glaring vengefully at his assailant, and rubbing the
while such of the weals on his back as he could reach.
Annoyed as I felt at the unprofessional <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fracas</i>, I
could scarcely help laughing at the man&rsquo;s appearance.
I doubt the possibility of any one looking heroic after
such a thrashing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the law for this,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
paid to be beaten by a madman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re paid to do my work, not another&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said
Carriston. &ldquo;Go to the man who has over-bribed you
and sent you to tell me your lies. Go to him, tell him
that once more he has failed. Out of my sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Carriston showed signs of recommencing hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
operations, the man flew as far as the door-way. There,
being in comparative safety, he turned with a malignant
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll smart for this,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;when they lock
you up as a raving lunatic I&rsquo;ll try and get a post as
keeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was glad to see that Carriston paid no attention to
this parting shaft. He turned his back scornfully, and
the fellow left the room and the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now are you convinced?&rdquo; asked Carriston, turning
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Convinced of what? That his tale is untrue, or
that he has been misled, I am quite certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tush! That is not worth consideration. Don&rsquo;t
you see that Ralph has done all this? I set that man
to watch him; he found out the espionage; suborned
my agent, or your agent, I should say; sent him here
with a trumped-up tale. Oh, yes; I was to believe
that Madeline had deserted me&mdash;that was to drive me
out of my senses. My cousin is a fool after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without further proof I cannot believe that your
suspicions are correct,&rdquo; I said; but I must own I spoke
with some hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proof! A clever man like you ought to see ample
proof in the fact of that wretch having twice called me
a madman. I have seen him but once before&mdash;you
know if I then gave him any grounds for making such
an assertion. Tell me, from whom could he have
learned the word except from Ralph Carriston?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was bound, if only to save my own reputation for
sagacity, to confess that the point noted by Carriston
had raised certain doubts in my mind. But if Ralph
Carriston really was trying by some finely-wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
scheme to bring about what he desired, there was all
the more reason for great caution to be exercised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you beat him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He will now
swear right and left that you are not in your senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he will. What do I care?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only remember this. It is easier to get put into
an asylum than to get out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so very easy for a sane man like myself
to be put in, especially when he is on his guard. I
have looked up the law. There must be a certificate
signed by two doctors, surgeons&mdash;or, I believe, apothecaries
will do&mdash;who have seen the supposed lunatic
alone and together. I&rsquo;ll take very good care I speak
to no doctor save yourself, and keep out of the way of
surgeons and apothecaries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It quite cheered me to hear him speaking so sensibly
and collectedly about himself, but I again impressed
upon him the need of great caution. Although
I could not believe that his cousin had taken Madeline
away, I was inclined to think, after the affair with the
spy, that, as Carriston averred, he aimed at getting him,
sane or insane, into a mad-house.</p>

<p>But after all these days we were not a step nearer to
the discovery of Madeline&rsquo;s whereabouts. Carriston
made no sign of doing anything to facilitate that discovery.
Again I urged him to intrust the whole affair
to the police. Again he refused to do so, adding that
he was not quite ready. Ready for what, I wondered!</p>


<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I must</span> confess, in spite of my affection for Carriston,
I felt inclined to rebel against the course which
matters were taking. I was a prosaic matter-of-fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
medical man; doing my work to the best of my ability
and anxious when that work was done that my hours
of leisure should be as free from worry and care as
possible. With Carriston&rsquo;s advent several disturbing
elements entered into my quiet life.</p>

<p>Let Ralph Carriston be guilty or innocent of the
extraordinary crime which his cousin laid at his door,
I felt that he was anxious to obtain possession of the
supposed lunatic&rsquo;s person. It would suit his purposes
for his cousin to be proved mad. I did not believe
that even if the capture was legally effected Carriston&rsquo;s
liberation would be a matter of great difficulty so long
as he remained in his present state of mind; so long as
I, a doctor of some standing, could go into the witness-box
and swear to his sanity. But my old dread was
always with me&mdash;the dread that any further shock
would overturn the balance of his sensitive mind.</p>

<p>So it was that every hour that Carriston was out of
my sight was fraught with anxiety. If Ralph Carriston
was really as unscrupulous as my friend supposed;
if he had really, as seemed almost probable, suborned
our agent; he might by some crafty trick obtain the
needful certificate, and some day I should come home
and find Carriston had been removed. In such a case
I foresaw great trouble and distress.</p>

<p>Besides, after all that had occurred, it was as much
as I could do to believe that Carriston was not mad.
Any doctor who knew what I knew would have given
the verdict against him.</p>

<p>After dismissing his visions and hallucinations with
the contempt which they deserved, the fact of a man
who was madly, passionately in love with a woman,
and who believed that she had been entrapped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
was still kept in restraint, sitting down quietly, and
letting day after day pass without making an effort
toward finding her, was in itself <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> evidence
of insanity. A sane man would at once have set all
the engines of detection at work.</p>

<p>I felt that if once Ralph Carriston obtained possession
of him he could make out a strong case in his own
favor. First of all, the proposed marriage out of the
defendant&rsquo;s own sphere of life; the passing under a
false name; the ridiculous, or apparently ridiculous,
accusation made against his kinsman; the murderous
threats; the chastisement of his own paid agent who
brought him a report which might not seem at all untrue
to any one who knew not Madeline Rowan.
Leaving out the question what might be wrung from
me in cross-examination, Ralph Carriston had a strong
case, and I knew that, once in his power, my friend
might possibly be doomed to pass years, if not his
whole life, under restraint. So I was anxious&mdash;very
anxious.</p>

<p>And I felt an anxiety, scarcely second to that which
prevailed on Carriston&rsquo;s account, as to the fate of
Madeline. Granting for sake of argument that Carriston&rsquo;s
absurd conviction that no bodily harm had as
yet been done her, was true, I felt sure that she with
her scarcely less sensitive nature must feel the separation
from her lover as much as he himself felt the separation
from her. Once or twice I tried to comfort
myself with cynicism&mdash;tried to persuade myself that a
young woman could not in our days be spirited away&mdash;that
she had gone by her own free-will&mdash;that there
was a man who had at the eleventh hour alienated her
affections from Carriston. But I could not bring myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to believe this. So I was placed between the horns
of a dilemma.</p>

<p>If Madeline had not fled of her own free-will, some
one must have taken her away, and if so our agent&rsquo;s
report was a coined one, and, if a coined one, issued at
Ralph&rsquo;s instance; therefore Ralph must be the prime
actor in the mystery.</p>

<p>But in sober moments such a deduction seemed an
utter absurdity.</p>

<p>Although I have said that Carriston was doing
nothing toward clearing up the mystery, I wronged
him in so saying. After his own erratic way he was
at work. At such work too! I really lost all patience
with him.</p>

<p>He shut himself up in his room, out of which he
scarcely stirred for three days. By that time he had
completed a large and beautiful drawing of his imaginary
man. This he took to a well-known photographer&rsquo;s,
and ordered several hundred small photographs
of it, to be prepared as soon as possible. The minute
description which he had given me of his fanciful creation
was printed at the foot of each copy. As soon
as the first batch of these precious photographs was
sent home, to my great joy he did what he should
have done days ago; yielded to my wishes, and put
the matter into the hands of the police.</p>

<p>I was glad to find that in giving details of what had
happened he said nothing about the advisability of
keeping a watch on Ralph Carriston&rsquo;s proceedings.
He did, indeed, offer an absurdly large reward for the
discovery of the missing girl; and, moreover, gave the
officer in charge of the case a packet of photographs
of his phantom man, telling him in the gravest manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that he knew the original of that likeness had
something to do with the disappearance of Miss
Rowan. The officer, who thought the portrait was
that of a natural being, took his instructions in good
faith, although he seemed greatly surprised when he
heard that Carriston knew neither the name nor the
occupation, in fact, knew nothing concerning the man
who was to be sought for. However, as Carriston assured
him that finding this man would insure the reward
as much as if he found Madeline, the officer
readily promised to combine the two tasks, little knowing
what waste of time any attempt to perform the
latter must be.</p>

<p>Two days after this Carriston came to me. &ldquo;I shall
leave you to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Why do you
leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to travel about. I have no intention
of letting Ralph get hold of me. So I mean to go
from place to place until I find Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; I urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be careful enough. I&rsquo;ll take care that no
doctors, surgeons, or even apothecaries get on my
track. I shall go just as the fit seizes me. If I can&rsquo;t
say one day where I shall be the next, it will be impossible
for that villain to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was not a bad argument. In fact, if he carried
out his resolve of passing quickly from place to place
I did not see how he could plan anything more likely
to defeat the intentions with which we credited his
cousin. As to his finding Madeline by so doing, that
was another matter.</p>

<p>His idea seemed to be that chance would sooner or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
later bring him in contact with the man of his dream.
However, now that the search had been intrusted to
the proper persons his own action in the matter was
not worth troubling about. I gave him many cautions.
He was to be quiet and guarded in words and manner.
He was not to converse with strangers. If he found
himself dogged or watched by any one he was to communicate
at once with me. But, above all, I begged
him not to yield again to his mental infirmity. The
folly of a man who could avoid it, throwing himself
into such a state ought to be apparent to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not oftener than I can help,&rdquo; was all the promise
I could get from him. &ldquo;But see her I must sometimes,
or I shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had now given up as hopeless the combat with his
peculiar idiosyncrasy. So, with many expressions of
gratitude on his part, we bade each other farewell.</p>

<p>During his absence he wrote to me nearly every day,
so that I might know his whereabouts in case I had
any news to communicate. But I had none. The
police failed to find the slightest clew. I had been
called upon by them once or twice in order that they
might have every grain of information I could give.
I took the liberty of advising them not to waste their
time in looking for the man, as his very existence was
problematical. It was but a fancy of my friend&rsquo;s, and
not worth thinking seriously about. I am not sure
but what after hearing this they did not think the whole
affair was an imagined one, and so relaxed their efforts.</p>

<p>Once or twice, Carriston, happening to be in the
neighborhood of London, came to see me, and slept
the night at my house. He also had no news to report.
Still, he seemed hopeful as ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>The weeks went by until Christmas was over and
the New Year begun; but no sign, word, or trace of
Madeline Rowan. &ldquo;I have seen her,&rdquo; wrote Carriston,
&ldquo;several times. She is in the same place&mdash;unhappy,
but not ill-treated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently his hallucinations were still in full force.</p>

<p class="dots">. . . . . . .</p>

<p>At first I intended that the whole of this tale should
be told by myself; but upon getting so far it struck
me that the evidence of another actor who played an
important part in the drama would give certain occurrences
to the reader at first instead of at second hand,
so I wrote to my friend Dick Fenton, of Frenchay,
Gloucestershire, and begged him, if he found himself
capable of so doing, to put in simple narrative form
his impressions of certain events which happened in
January, 1866: events in which we two were concerned.
He has been good enough to comply with
my request. His communication follows.</p>

<h3>PART II.<br />
<br />
<span class="f9">TOLD BY RICHARD FENTON, OF FRENCHAY, GLOUCESTERSHIRE,
ESQUIRE.</span></h3>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> my old friend Phil Brand has asked me to do
this, I suppose I must. Brand is a right good fellow
and a clever fellow, but has plenty of crotchets of his
own. The worst I know of him is that he insists upon
having his own with people. With those who differ
from him he is as obstinate as a mule. Anyhow, he
has always had his own way with me. This custom,
so far as I am concerned, commenced years ago when
we were boys at school together, and I have never been
able to shake off the bad habit of giving in to him.
He has promised to see that my queen&rsquo;s English is
presentable: for, to tell the truth, I am more at home
across country than across foolscap, and my fingers
know the feel of the reins or the trigger better than
that of the pen.</p>

<p>All the same I hope he won&rsquo;t take too many liberties
with my style, bad though it may be; for old
Brand at times is apt to get&mdash;well, a bit prosy. To
hear him on the subject of hard work and the sanctity
thereof approaches the sublime!</p>

<p>What freak took me to the little God-forsaken village
of Midcombe in the depth of winter is entirely
between myself and my conscience. The cause having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
no bearing upon the matters I am asked to tell you about,
is no one&rsquo;s business but mine. I will only say that now
I would not stay in such a place at such a time of the
year for the sake of the prettiest girl in the world, let
alone the bare chance of meeting her once or twice.
But one&rsquo;s ideas change. I am now a good bit older,
ride some two stones heavier, and have been married
ever so many years. Perhaps, after all, as I look back
I can find some excuse for being such an ass as to endure
for more than a fortnight all the discomforts
heaped upon me in that little village inn.</p>

<p>A man who sojourns in such a hole as Midcombe
must give some reason for doing so. My ostensible
reason was hunting. I had a horse with me, and a
second-rate subscription pack of slow-going mongrels
did meet somewhere in the neighborhood, so no one
could gainsay my explanation. But if hunting was
my object, I got precious little of it. A few days after
my arrival a bitter, biting frost set in&mdash;a frost as
black as your hat and as hard as nails. Yet still I
stayed on.</p>

<p>From private information received&mdash;no matter how,
when or where&mdash;I knew that some people in the
neighborhood had organized a party to go skating on a
certain day at Lilymere, a fine sheet of water some
distance from Midcombe. I guessed that some one
whom I particularly desired to meet would be there,
and as the skating at Lilymere was free to any one
who chose to take the trouble of getting to such an
out-of-the-way place, I hired a horse and an apology
for a dog-cart, and at ten in the morning started to
drive the twelve miles to the pond. I took no one
with me. I had been to Lilymere once before, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
bright summer weather, so fancied I knew the way
well enough.</p>

<p>The sky when I started was cloudy; the wind was
chopping round in a way which made the effete rustic
old hostler predict a change of weather. He was
right. Before I had driven two miles light snow began
to fall, and by the time I reached a little wretched
wayside inn, about a mile from the Mere, a film of
white covered the whole country. I stabled my horse
as well as I could, then taking my skates with me
walked down to the pond.</p>

<p>Now, whether I had mistaken the day, or whether
the threatening fall of snow had made certain people
change their minds, I don&rsquo;t know; but, to my annoyance
and vexation, no skaters were to be seen, and
moreover, the uncut, white surface told me that none
had been on the pond that morning. Still hoping they
might come in spite of the weather, I put on my
skates and went outside-edging and grape-vining all
over the place. But as there was no person in particular&mdash;in
fact, no one at all&mdash;to note my powers, I soon
got tired. It was, indeed, dreary, dreary work. But
I waited and hoped until the snow came down so fast
and furiously that I felt sure that waiting was in vain,
and that I had driven to Lilymere for nothing.</p>

<p>Back I went to the little inn, utterly disgusted with
things in general, and feeling that to break some one&rsquo;s
head would be a relief to me in my present state of
mind. Of course a sensible man would at once have
got his horse between the shafts and driven home.
But whatever I may be now, in those days I was not a
sensible man&mdash;Brand will, I know, cordially indorse
this remark&mdash;the accommodation of the inn was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
such as to induce one to linger within its precincts;
but the fire was a right good one, and a drink, which I
skilfully manufactured out of some hot beer, not to be
despised, and proved warming to the body and soothing
to the ruffled temper. So I lingered over the big fire until
I began to feel hungry, and upon the landlady assuring
me that she could cook a rasher, decided it would be
wiser to stay where I was until the violence of the
snowstorm was over; for coming down it was now,
and no mistake.</p>

<p>And it kept on coming down. About half-past
three, when I sorrowfully decided I was bound to
make a move, it was snowing faster than ever. I harnessed
my horse, and laughing at the old woman&rsquo;s dismal
prophecy that I should never get to Midcombe in
such weather, gathered up the reins, and away I went
along the white road.</p>

<p>I thought I knew the way well enough. In fact I
had always prided myself upon remembering any road
once driven over by me; but does any one who has
not tried it really know how a heavy fall of snow
changes the aspect of the country, and makes landmarks
snares and delusions? I learned all about it
then, once and for all. I found, also, that the snow lay
much deeper than I thought could possibly be in so
short a time, and it still fell in a manner almost blinding.
Yet I went on bravely and merrily for some
miles. Then came a bit of uncertainty&mdash;</p>

<p>Which of those two roads was the right one? This
one, of course&mdash;no, the other. There was no house
near; no one was likely to be passing in such weather,
so I was left to exercise my free, unbiased choice; a
privilege I would willingly have dispensed with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
However, I made the best selection I could, and followed
it for some two miles. Then I began to grow
doubtful, and soon persuading myself that I was on
the wrong track, retraced my steps. I was by this
time something like a huge white plaster of Paris figure,
and the snow which had accumulated on the old
dog-cart made it run heavier by half-a-ton, more or
less. By the time I came to that unlucky junction of
roads at which my misfortune began it was almost
dark; the sky as black as a tarpaulin, yet sending
down the white feathery flakes thicker and faster than
ever. I felt inclined to curse my folly in attempting
such a drive, at any rate I blamed myself for not having
started two or three hours earlier. I&rsquo;ll warrant
that steady-going old Brand never had to accuse himself
of such foolishness as mine.</p>

<p>Well, I took the other road; went on some way;
came to a turning which I seemed to remember; and,
not without misgivings, followed it. My misgivings
increased when, after a little while, I found the road
grew full of ruts, which the snow and the darkness
quite concealed from me until the wheels got into
them. Evidently I was wrong again. I was just
thinking of making the best of my way out of this
rough and unfrequented road, when&mdash;there, I don&rsquo;t
know how it happened, such things seldom occur to
me&mdash;a stumble, a fall on the part of my tired horse
sent me flying over the dashboard, with the only consoling
thought that the reins were still in my hand.</p>

<p>Luckily the snow had made the falling pretty soft.
I soon picked myself up and set about estimating damages.
With some difficulty I got the horse out of the
harness, and then felt free to inspect the dog-cart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Alas! after the manner of the two-wheel kind whenever
a horse thinks fit to fall, one shaft had snapped
off like a carrot; so here was I, five miles apparently
from anywhere, in the thick of a blinding snow-storm,
left standing helpless beside a jaded horse and a broken
cart&mdash;I should like to know what Brand would have
done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>As for me, I reflected for some minutes&mdash;reflection
in a snow-storm is weary work. I reasoned, I believe
logically, and at last came to this decision: I would
follow the road. If, as I suspected, it was but a cart-track,
it would probably soon lead to a habitation of
some kind. Anyway I had better try a bit further.
I took hold of the wearied horse, and with snow under
my feet, snow-flakes whirling round me, and a wind
blowing right into my teeth, struggled on.</p>

<p>It was a journey! I think I must have been three-quarters
of an hour going about a quarter of a mile.
I was just beginning to despair, when I saw a welcome
gleam of light. I steered toward it, fondly hoping that
my troubles were at an end. I found the light stole
through the ill-fitting window-shutters of what seemed,
so far as I could make out in the darkness, to be a
small farm-house. Tying to a gate the knotted reins
by which I had been leading the horse, I staggered up
to the door and knocked loudly. Upon my honor,
until I leaned against that door-post I had no idea how
tired I was&mdash;until that moment I never suspected that
the finding of speedy shelter meant absolutely saving
my life. Covered from head to foot with snow, my
hat crushed in, I must have been a pitiable object.</p>

<p>No answer came to my first summons. It was only
after a second and more imperative application of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
heel that the door deigned to give way a few inches.
Through the aperture a woman&rsquo;s voice asked who was
there?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have missed my way to
Midcombe. My horse has fallen. You must give me
shelter for the night. Open the door and let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shelter! You can&rsquo;t get shelter here, mister,&rdquo; said
a man&rsquo;s gruff voice. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t an inn, so you&rsquo;d best
be off and go elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must come in,&rdquo; I said, astonished at such inhospitality;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go a step further. Open the
door at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You be hanged,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my house,
not yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, you fool, I mean to pay you well for your
trouble. Don&rsquo;t you know it means death wandering
about on such a night as this? Let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come in here,&rdquo; was the brutal and boorish
reply. The door closed.</p>

<p>That I was enraged at such incivility may be easily
imagined; but if I said I was thoroughly frightened
I believe no one would be surprised. As getting into
that house meant simply life or death to me, into that
house I determined to get, by door or window, by fair
means or by foul. So, as the door closed, I hurled
myself against it with all the might I could muster.
Although I ride much heavier now than I did then,
all my weight at that time was bone and muscle. The
violence of my attack tore from the lintel the staple
which held the chain; the door went back with a bang,
and I fell forward into the house, fully resolved to
stay there whether welcome or unwelcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> door through which I had burst like a battering
ram opened straight into a sort of kitchen, so although
I entered in a most undignified way, in fact on
my hands and knees, I was well-established in the centre
of the room before the man and woman emerged
from behind the door, where my successful assault had
thrown them. I stood up and faced them. They
were a couple of ordinary, respectably-attired country
people. The man, a sturdy, strong-built, bull-necked
rascal, stood scowling at me, and, I concluded, making
up his mind as to what course to pursue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good people,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are behaving in
the most unheard-of manner. Can&rsquo;t you understand
that I mean to pay you well for any trouble I give
you? But whether you like it or not, here I stay to-night.
To turn me out would be sheer murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying I pulled off my overcoat, and began shaking
the snow out of my whiskers.</p>

<p>I dare say my determined attitude, my respectable,
as well as my muscular appearance, impressed my unwilling
hosts. Anyway, they gave in without more
ado. Whilst the woman shut the door, through which
the snow-flakes were whirling, the man said sullenly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to spend the night on a chair.
We&rsquo;ve no beds here for strangers. &rsquo;Specially those as
ain&rsquo;t wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, my friend. Having settled the matter
you may as well make yourself pleasant. Go out and
put my horse under cover, and give him a feed of some
sort&mdash;make a mash if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After giving the woman a quick glance as of warning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
my scowling host lit a horn lantern, and went on
the errand I suggested. I gladly sank into a chair, and
warmed myself before a cheerful fire. The prospect
of spending the night amid such discomfort was not
alluring, but I had, at least, a roof over my head.</p>

<p>As a rule, the more churlish the nature, the more
avaricious it is found to be. My promise of liberal
remuneration was, after all, not without its effect upon
the strange couple whose refusal to afford me refuge
had so nearly endangered my life. They condescended
to get me some tea and rough food. After I had disposed
of all that, the man produced a bottle of gin.
We filled our glasses, and then, with the aid of my
pipe, I settled down to make the best of a night spent
in a hard wooden chair.</p>

<p>I had come across strange people in my travels, but
I have no hesitation in saying that my host was the
sullenest, sulkiest, most boorish specimen of human
nature I had as yet met with. In spite of his recent
ill-treatment of me I was quite ready to establish matters
on a friendly footing, and made several attempts
to draw him into conversation. The brute would only
answer in monosyllables, or often not answer at all.
So I gave up talking as a bad job, and sat in silence,
smoking and looking into the fire, thinking a good deal,
it may be, of some one I should have met that morning
at Lilymere had the wretched snow but kept off.</p>

<p>The long clock&mdash;that cumbrous eight-day machine
which inevitably occupies one corner of every cottager&rsquo;s
kitchen&mdash;struck nine. The woman rose and left us.
I concluded she was going to bed. If so, I envied her.
Her husband showed no sign of retiring. He still sat
over the fire, opposite me. By this time I was dreadfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
tired: every bone in my body ached. The hard
chair which an hour or two ago, seemed all I could desire,
now scarcely came up to my ideas of the comfort
I was justly entitled to claim. My sulky companion
had been drinking silently but steadily. Perhaps the
liquor he had poured into himself might have rendered
his frame of mind more pleasant and amenable to
reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;your chairs are excellent
ones of the kind, but deucedly uncomfortable. I
am horribly tired. If the resources of your establishment
can&rsquo;t furnish a bed for me to sleep in, couldn&rsquo;t
you find a mattress or something to lay down before
the fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got all you&rsquo;ll get to-night,&rdquo; he answered,
knocking the ashes out his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I say. I say this: If you don&rsquo;t like it you
can leave it. We didn&rsquo;t ask you to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You infernal beast,&rdquo; I muttered&mdash;and meant it
too&mdash;I declare had I not been so utterly worn out, I
would have had that bullet-headed ruffian up for a few
rounds on his own kitchen floor, and tried to knock
him into a more amiable frame of mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but, remember, civility
costs nothing, and often gets rewarded. However, if
you wish to retire to your own couch don&rsquo;t let your
native politeness stand in your way. Pray don&rsquo;t hesitate
on my account. Leave plenty of fuel, and I shall
manage until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you stay, I stay,&rdquo; he answered. Then he
filled his pipe, and once more relapsed into stony
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>I bothered about him no more. I dozed off for a
few minutes&mdash;woke&mdash;dozed off again for some hours.
I was in an uncomfortable sort of half sleep, crammed
full of curious dreams&mdash;dreams from which I started,
wondering where I was and how I got there. I even
began to grow nervous. All sorts of horrible travellers&rsquo;
tales ran through my head. It was in just such places
as this that unsuspecting voyagers were stated to have
been murdered and robbed, by just such unmitigated
ruffians as my host&mdash;I can tell you that altogether I
spent a most pleasant night.</p>

<p>To make matters worse and more dismal the storm
still raged outside. The wind moaned through the
trees, but it had again changed, and I knew from the
sound on the window-panes that heavy rain had succeeded
snow. As the big drops of water found their
way down the large old-fashioned chimney, the fire
hissed and spluttered like a spiteful vixen. Everything
combined to deprive me of what dog&rsquo;s sleep I could
by sheer persistency snatch.</p>

<p>I think I tried every position which an ordinary
man, not an acrobat, is capable of adopting with the
assistance of a common wooden chair. I even lay down
on the hard flags. I actually tried the table. I propped
up the upper half of my body against the corner walls
of the room; but found no rest. At last I gave up all
idea of sleeping, and fully aroused myself. I comforted
myself by saying that my misery was only temporary&mdash;that
the longest night must come to an end.</p>

<p>My companion had by now succumbed to fatigue,
or to the combined effects of fatigue and gin-and-water.
His head was hanging sideways, and he slept in a most
uncomfortable attitude. I chuckled as I looked at him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
feeling quite sure that if such a clod was capable of
dreaming at all, his dreams must be worse even than
mine. I filled another pipe, poked the smoldering logs
into a blaze, and sat almost nose and knees over the
fire, finding some amusement in speculating upon the
condition of the churl before me, and thanking the
Lord I was not like unto this man. Suddenly an idea
flashed across me.</p>

<p>I had seen this fellow before. But when or where
I could not remember. His features, as I looked at
them with keener interest, seemed to grow more and
more familiar to me. Where could I have met him?
Somewhere or other, but where? I racked my brain
to associate him with some scene, some event. Although
he was but an ordinary countryman, such as one
sees scores of in a day&rsquo;s ride, only differing from his
kind on account of his unpleasant face, I felt sure we
were old acquaintances. When he awoke for a moment
and changed his strained attitude, my feeling
grew stronger and stronger. Yet puzzle and puzzle
as I would I could not call to mind a former encounter;
so at last I began to think the supposed recognition
was pure fancy on my part.</p>

<p>Having smoked out several pipes, I thought that a
cigar would be a slight break to the monotony of the
night&rsquo;s proceedings. So I drew out my case and looked
at its contents. Among the weeds was one of a lighter
color than the others. As I took it out I said to myself,
&ldquo;Why, old Brand gave me that one when I was
last at his house.&rdquo; Curiously enough that cigar was
the missing link in the chain of my memory. As I
held it in my hand I knew at once why my host&rsquo;s ugly
face seemed familiar to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>About a fortnight before, being in town, I had
spent the evening with the doctor. He was not alone,
and I was introduced to a tall pale young man named
Carriston. He was a pleasant, polite young fellow,
although not much in my line. At first I judged him
to be a would-be poet of the fashionable miserable
school; but finding that he and Brand talked so much
about art I eventually decided that he was one of the
doctor&rsquo;s many artist friends. Art is a hobby he hacks
about on grandly. (Mem. Brand&rsquo;s own attempt at
pictures are simply atrocious!)</p>

<p>Just before I left, Carriston, the doctor&rsquo;s back being
turned, asked me to step into another room. There
he showed me the portrait of a man. It seemed very
cleverly drawn, and I presumed he wanted me to criticise
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a precious bad judge,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not asking you to pass an opinion,&rdquo; said Carriston.
&ldquo;I want to beg a favor of you. I am almost
ashamed to beg it on so short an acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed modest, and not in want of money, so I
encouraged him to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you say you were going into the country,&rdquo;
he resumed. &ldquo;I want to ask you if by any chance you
should meet the original of that drawing to telegraph
at once to Dr. Brand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts does he live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea. If chance throws him in your
way please do as I ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will,&rdquo; I said, seeing the young man
made the request in solemn earnest.</p>

<p>He thanked me, and then gave me a small photograph
of the picture. This photograph he begged me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to keep in my pocket-book, so that I might refer to it
in case I met the man he wanted. I put it there,
went my way, and, am sorry to say, forget all about it.
Had it not been for the strange cigar in my case bringing
back Carriston&rsquo;s unusual request to my mind, the
probabilities are that I should not have thought again
of the matter. Now, by a remarkable coincidence, I
was spending the night with the very man, who, so
far as my memory served me, must have sat for the
portrait shown me at Brand&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what I did with the photo,&rdquo; I said. I
turned out my letter-case. There it was, right enough!
Shading it with one hand, I carefully compared it with
the sleeper.</p>

<p>Not a doubt about it! So far as a photograph taken
from a picture can go, it was the man himself. The
same ragged beard, the same coarse features, the same
surly look. Young Carriston was evidently a wonderful
hand at knocking off a likeness. Moreover, in
case I had felt any doubt in the matter, a printed note
at the bottom of the photograph said that one joint
was missing from a right-hand finger. Sure enough,
my friend lacked that small portion of his misbegotten
frame.</p>

<p>This discovery threw me in an ecstasy of delight. I
laughed so loudly that I almost awoke the ruffian. I
guessed I was going to take a glorious revenge for all
the discomforts I had suffered. No one, I felt sure,
could be looking for such a fellow as this to do any
good to him. I was quite happy in the thought, and
for the remainder of the night gloated over the idea
of putting a spoke in the wheel of one who had been
within an ace of causing my death. I resolved, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
moment I got back to civilization, to send the desired
intelligence to Brand, and hope for the best.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> end of that wretched night came at last. When
the welcome morning broke I found that a great
change had taken place out-of-doors. The fierce
snow-storm had been the farewell of the frost. The
heavy rain that followed had filled the roads with
slushy and rapidly-thawing snow. I managed to extort
some of a breakfast from my host, then, having
recompensed him according to my promise, not his
deserts, started, as soon as I could, on the bare back
of my unfortunate steed, for Midcombe, which place,
after my night&rsquo;s experience, seemed gifted with merits
not its own.</p>

<p>I was surprised upon leaving the house to find it
was of larger dimensions than, from the little I saw of
it during the night, I had imagined. It was altogether
a better class of residence than I had supposed. My
surly friend accompanied me until he had placed me on
the main road, where I could make no possible mistake.
He was kind enough to promise to assist any one I
might send out in getting the dog-cart once more under
way. Then, with a hearty wish on my part that I
might never again meet with his like, we parted.</p>

<p>I found my way to Midcombe without much trouble.
I took off my things, had a wash, and, like a sensible
man for once, went to bed. But I did not forget to
send a boy straight off to the nearest telegraph station.
My message to Brand was a brief one. It simply
said: &ldquo;Tell your friend I have found his man.&rdquo;
This duty done, I dismissed all speculation as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
result from my mind, and settled down to make up
arrears of sleep.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the reply received that same evening
from Brand: &ldquo;We shall be with you as soon as
we can get down to-morrow. Meet us at station.&rdquo;
From this it was clear that my friend was wanted particularly&mdash;all
the better! I turned to the time-table
and found that, owing to changes and delays, they
could not get to C&mdash;&mdash;, the nearest station to Midcombe,
until three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. I inquired
about the crippled dog-cart. It had been brought in;
so I left strict instructions that a shaft of some sort
was to be rigged in time for me to drive over the next
day and meet the doctor and his friend.</p>

<p>They came as promised. It was a comfort to see
friends of any description, so I gave them a hearty
welcome. Carriston took hold of both my hands, and
shook them so warmly that I began to feel I had discovered
a long-lost father of his in my friend. I had
almost forgotten the young fellow&rsquo;s appearance, or he
looked a very different man to-day from the one I had
seen when last we met. Then he was a wan, pensive,
romantic, poetical-looking sort of fellow; now he seemed
full of energy, vitality, and grit. Poor old Brand
looked as serious as an undertaker engaged in burying
his own mother.</p>

<p>Carriston began to question me, but Brand stopped
him. &ldquo;You promised I should make inquiries first,&rdquo;
he said. Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Richard,&rdquo;&mdash;when he calls me Richard
I know he is fearfully in earnest&mdash;&ldquo;I believe you have
brought us down on a fool&rsquo;s errand; but let us go to
some place where we can talk together for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>I lead them across the road to the Railway Inn. We
entered a room, and, having for the sake of appearances
ordered a little light refreshment, told the waiter to
shut the door from the outside. Brand settled down
with the air of a cross-examining counsel. I expected
to see him pull out a New Testament and put me on
my oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before we go further
I want to know your reasons for thinking this
man, about whom you telegraphed, is Carriston&rsquo;s man,
as you call him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reasons! Why of course he is the man. Carriston
gave me his photograph. The likeness is indisputable&mdash;leaving
the finger-joint out of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Carriston looked at my cross-examiner triumphantly.
The meaning of that look I have never to
this hour understood. But I laughed because I knew
old Brand had for once made a mistake, and was going
to be called to account for it. Carriston was about to
speak, but the doctor waved him aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Richard, think very carefully. You speak
of the missing finger-joint. We doctors know how
many people persuade themselves into all sorts of
thing. Tell me, did you notice the likeness before
you saw the mutilated finger, or did the fact of the
finger&rsquo;s being mutilated bring the likeness to your
mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless the man!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;one would think I had
no eyes. I tell you there is no doubt about this man
being the original of the photo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind; answer my question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I am ashamed to confess it, but I put
the photo in my pocket, and forgot all about it until I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
had recognized the man, and pulled out the likeness
to make sure. I didn&rsquo;t even know there was a printed
description at the foot, nor that any member was
wanting. Confound it, Brand! I&rsquo;m not such a duffer
as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brand did not retaliate. He turned to his friend
and said gravely, &ldquo;To me the matter is inexplicable.
Take your own course, as I promised you should.&rdquo;
Then he sat down, looking deliciously crest-fallen, and
wearing the discontented expression always natural to
him when worsted in argument.</p>

<p>It was now Carriston&rsquo;s turn. He plied me with
many questions. In fact, I gave him the whole history
of my adventure. &ldquo;What kind of house is it?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better than a cottage&mdash;scarcely a farm-house. A
place, I should think, with a few miserable acres of
bad land belonging to it. One of those wretched little
holdings which are simply curses to the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made lots of other inquiries, the purport of
which I could not then divine. He seemed greatly
impressed when I told him that the man had never for
a moment left me alone. He shot a second glance of
triumph at Brand, who still kept silent, and looked as
if all the wind had been taken out of his sails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far is the place?&rdquo; asked Carriston. &ldquo;Could
you drive me there after dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this question the doctor returned to life. &ldquo;What
do you mean to do?&rdquo; he asked his friend. &ldquo;Let us
have no nonsense. Even now I feel sure that Fenton
is mislead by some chance resemblance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deuce a bit, old chap,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whether or not, we needn&rsquo;t do foolish things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
We must go and swear information, and get a search-warrant,
and the assistance of the police. The truth
is, Richard,&rdquo; he continued, turning to me, &ldquo;we have
reason to believe, or I should say Carriston persists in
fancying, that a friend of his has for some time been
kept in durance by the man whom you say you recognized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likely enough,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He looked villain enough
for anything up to murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Brand, &ldquo;we must do everything
according to law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law! I want no law,&rdquo; answered Carriston. &ldquo;I
have found her, as I knew I should find her. I shall
simply fetch her, and at once. You can come with
me or stay here, as you like, doctor; but I am afraid I
must trouble your friend to drive me somewhere near
the place he speaks of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Foreseeing an adventure and great fun&mdash;moreover,
not unmoved by thoughts of revenge&mdash;I placed myself
entirely at Carriston&rsquo;s disposal. He expressed his
gratitude, and suggested that we should start at once.
In a few minutes we were ready, and mounted the dog-cart.
Brand, after grumbling loudly at the whole
proceeding, finished up by following us, and installing
himself in the back seat. Carriston placed a parcel
he carried inside the cart, and away we went.</p>

<p>It was now nearly dark, and raining cats and dogs.
I had my lamps lighted, so we got along without much
difficulty. The roads were deep with mud; but by
this time the snow had been pretty nearly washed away
from everywhere. I don&rsquo;t make a mistake in a road
twice, so in due course we reached the scene of my upset.
Here I drew up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The house lies about five hundred yards up the
lane,&rdquo; I told Carriston; &ldquo;we had better get out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the horse?&rdquo; asked Brand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chance of any one passing this way on such a
night as this; so let us put out the lamps and tie him
up somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did so; then struggled on afoot until we saw
the gleam of light which had been so welcomed by me
two nights before.</p>

<p>It was just about as dark as pitch; but guided by
the light, we went on until we stood in front of the
house, where a turf bank and a dry hedge hid us from
sight, although on such a night we had little fear of
our presence being discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do now?&rdquo; asked Brand in a
discontented whisper. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t break into the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carriston said nothing for a minute; then I felt
him place his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any horses; any cows about the place?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>I told him I thought that my surly friend rejoiced
in the possession of a horse and a cow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Then we must wait. He&rsquo;ll come
out to see to them before he goes to bed,&rdquo; said Carriston,
as decidedly as a general giving orders just before
a battle.</p>

<p>I could not see how Brand expressed his feelings
upon hearing this order from our commander&mdash;I
know I shrugged my shoulders, and if I said nothing,
I thought a deal. The present situation was all very
well for a strongly-interested party like Carriston, but
he could scarcely expect others to relish the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of waiting, it might be for hours, under that comfortless
hedge. We were all wet to the skin, and although
I was extremely anxious to see the end of the expedition,
and find poetical justice meted out to my late
host, Carriston&rsquo;s Fabian tactics lacked the excitement
I longed for. Brand, in spite of his disapproval of the
whole course of action, was better off than I was. As
a doctor, he must have felt sure that, provided he
could survive the exposure, he would secure two fresh
patients. However, we made no protest, but waited
for events to develop themselves.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than half an hour went by. I was growing
numbed and tired, and beginning to think that we
were making asses of ourselves, when I heard the rattle
of a chain, and felt Carriston give my arm a warning
touch. No doubt my late host had made sure that
his new door-fastenings were equal to a stronger test
than that to which I had subjected the former ones;
so we were wise in not attempting to carry his castle
by force.</p>

<p>The door opened, and closed again. I saw the feeble
glimmer of a lantern moving toward the out-house in
which my horse had been stabled. I heard a slight
rustling in the hedge, and, stretching out my arm,
found that Carriston had left my side. In the absence
of any command from him I did not follow, but resumed
the old occupation&mdash;waiting.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the light of the lantern reappeared;
the bearer stood on the threshold of the house, while
I wondered what Carriston was doing. Just as the
door was opened for the boor&rsquo;s readmittance, a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
figure sprung upon him! I heard a fierce oath and
cry of surprise; then the lantern flew out of the man&rsquo;s
hand, and he and his assailant tumbled struggling
through the narrow door-way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! the door is won, anyway!&rdquo; I shouted, as,
followed closely by the doctor, I jumped over the
hedge and rushed to the scene of the fray.</p>

<p>Although Carriston&rsquo;s well-conceived attack was so
vigorous and unexpected that the man went down
under it; although our leader utilized the advantage
he had gained in a proper and laudable manner, by
bumping that thick bullet-head as violently as he
could against the flags on which it lay; I doubt if,
after all, he could have done his work alone. The
countryman was a muscular brute and Carriston but a
stripling. However, our arrival speedily settled the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bind him!&rdquo; panted Carriston; &ldquo;there is a cord in
my pocket.&rdquo; He appeared to have come quite prepared
for contingencies. Whilst Carriston still embraced
his prostrate foe, and Brand, to facilitate matters,
knelt on his shoulders, sat on his head, or did
something else useful, I drew out from the first pocket
I tried a nice length of half-inch line, and had the immense
satisfaction of trussing up my scowling friend
in a most workmanlike manner. He must have felt
those turns on his wrists for days afterward. Yet
when we were at last at liberty to rise and leave him
lying helpless on his kitchen-floor, I considered I exercised
great self-denial in not bestowing a few kicks
upon him, as he swore at us in the broadest vernacular
in a way which, under the circumstances, was no doubt
a great comfort to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>We scarcely noticed the man&rsquo;s wife while we rendered
her husband helpless. As we entered she
attempted to fly out, but Brand, with a promptitude
which I am glad to record, intercepted her, closed the
door, turned and pocketed the key. After that the
woman sat on the floor and rocked herself to and fro.</p>

<p>For some moments, while recovering his breath,
Carriston stood, and positively glared at his prostrate
foe. At last he found words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she? Where is the key, you hound?&rdquo; he
thundered out, stooping over the fellow, and shaking
him with a violence which did my heart good. As he
received no answers save the unrecordable expressions
above mentioned, we unbuttoned the wretch&rsquo;s pockets,
and searched those greasy receptacles. Among the
usual litter we did certainly find a key. Carriston
snatched at it, and shouting &ldquo;Madeline! Madeline! I
come!&rdquo; rushed out of the room like a maniac, leaving
Brand and me to keep guard over our prisoners.</p>

<p>I filled a pipe, lit it, and then came back to my fallen
foe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, old chap!&rdquo; I said, stirring him gently with
the toe of my boot, &ldquo;this will be a lesson to you.
Remember, I told you that civility costs nothing. If
you had given me Christian bed accommodation instead
of making me wear out my poor bones on that infernal
chair, you could have jogged along in your rascality
quite comfortably, so far as I am concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was very ungrateful&mdash;so much so that my desire
to kick him was intensified. I should not like to swear
I did not to a slight degree yield to the temptation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Push a handkerchief in his mouth,&rdquo; cried Brand,
suddenly. &ldquo;A lady is coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>With right good-will I did as the doctor suggested.</p>

<p>Just then Carriston returned. I don&rsquo;t want to raise
home tempests, yet I must say he was accompanied by
the most beautiful creature my eyes have ever lighted
upon. True, she was pale as a lily&mdash;looked thin and
delicate, and her face bore traces of anxiety and suffering,
but for all that she was beautiful&mdash;too beautiful
for this world, I thought, as I looked at her. She was
clinging in a half-frightened, half-confiding way to
Carriston, and he&mdash;happy fellow!&mdash;regardless of our
presence, was showering down kisses on her sweet pale
face. Confound it! I grow quite romantic as I recall
the sight of those lovers.</p>

<p>A most curious young man, that Carriston! He
came to us, the lovely girl on his arm, without showing
a trace of his recent excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go now,&rdquo; he said, as calmly as if he had
been taking a quiet evening drive. Then he turned to
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Fenton, you could without much
trouble get the dog-cart up to the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said I would try to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about these people?&rdquo; asked Brand.</p>

<p>Carriston gave them a contemptuous glance. &ldquo;Leave
them alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are but the tools of
another&mdash;him I cannot touch. Let us go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. But why not verify your suspicions
while you can?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just like Brand! He&rsquo;s always wanting to verify
everything.</p>

<p>In searching for the key we had found some papers
on our prisoner. Brand examined them, and handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to Carriston an envelope which contained what looked
like bank-notes.</p>

<p>Carriston glanced at it. &ldquo;The handwriting is, of
course, disguised,&rdquo; he said, carelessly; &ldquo;but the postmark
shows whence it came. It is as I always told
you. You agree with me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I must,&rdquo; said Brand, humbly. &ldquo;But
we must do something about this man,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>Hereupon Carriston turned to our prisoner. &ldquo;Listen,
you villain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will let you go scot-free if
you breathe no word of this to your employer for the
next fortnight. If he learns from you what has happened
before that time, I swear you shall go to penal
servitude. Which do you choose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pulled out the gag, and it is needless to say which
the fellow chose.</p>

<p>Then I went off, and recovered the horse and cart.
I relighted the lamps, and with some difficulty got the
dog-cart up to the house, Carriston having exactly
anticipated the events of the night. The parcel he
had brought with him contained a bonnet and a thick,
warm cloth cloak. His beautiful friend was equipped
with these; then leaving the woman of the house to
untie her husband at her leisure and pleasure, away we
started; the doctor sitting by me; Carriston and the
lady behind.</p>

<p>We just managed to catch the last train from C&mdash;&mdash;.
Not feeling sure as to what form inquiries might take
to-morrow, I thought it better to go up to town with
my friends; so, as we passed through Midcombe, I
stopped, paid my bill, and gave instructions for my
luggage to be forwarded to me. By six o&rsquo;clock the
next morning we were all in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>


<h4>DR. BRAND IN CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I asked Fenton to relate his experiences I did
not mean him to do so at such length. But there, as
he has written it, and as writing is not a labor of love
with him, let it go.</p>

<p>When Madeline Rowan found the bed by the side
of which she had thrown herself in an ecstasy of grief
untenanted, she knew in a moment that she was the
victim of a deep-laid plot. Being ignorant of Carriston&rsquo;s
true position in the world she could conceive no
reason for the elaborate scheme which have been devised
to lure her so many miles from her home, and make a
prisoner of her.</p>

<p>A prisoner she was. Not only was the door locked
upon her, but a slip of paper lay on the bed. It bore
these words, &ldquo;No harm is meant you, and in due time
you will be released. Ask no questions, make no foolish
attempts at escape, and you will be well-treated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon reading this the girl&rsquo;s first thought was one of
thankfulness. She saw at once that the reported accident
to her lover was but an invention. The probabilities
were that Carriston was alive, and in his usual
health. Now that she felt certain of this, she could
bear anything.</p>

<p>From the day on which she entered that room, to
that on which we rescued her, Madeline was to all
intents and purposes as close a prisoner in that lonely
house on the hill-side as she might have been in the
deepest dungeon in the world. Threats, entreaties,
promises of bribes availed nothing. She was not unkindly
treated&mdash;that is, suffered no absolute ill-usage.
Books, materials for needle-work, and other little aids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to while away time were supplied. But the only living
creatures she saw were the women of the house
who attended to her wants, and, on one or two occasions,
the man whom Carriston asserted he had seen in
his trance. She had suffered from the close confinement,
but had always felt certain that sooner or later
her lover would find her, and effect her deliverance.
Now that she knew he was alive she could not be
unhappy.</p>

<p>I did not choose to ask her why she had felt so
certain on the above points. I wished to add no more
puzzles to the one which, to tell the truth, exercised,
even annoyed me, more than I care to say. But I did
ask her if, during her incarceration, her jailer had ever
laid his hand upon her.</p>

<p>She told me that some short time after her arrival a
stranger had gained admittance to the house. Whilst
he was there the man had entered her room, held her
arm, and threatened her with violence if she made
any outcry. After hearing this, I did not pursue the
subject.</p>

<p>Carriston and Madeline were married at the earliest
possible moment, and left England immediately after
the ceremony. A week after their departure, by Carriston&rsquo;s
request, I forwarded the envelope found upon
our prisoner to Mr. Ralph Carriston. With it I sent a
few lines stating where and under what peculiar circumstances
we had become possessed of it. I never received
any reply to my communication; so, wild and
improbable as it seems, I am bound to believe that
Charles Carriston&rsquo;s surmise was right&mdash;that Madeline
was decoyed away and concealed, not from any ill-will
toward herself, but with a view to the possible baneful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
effect which her mysterious disappearance might work
upon her lover&rsquo;s strange and excitable organization;
and I firmly believe that had he not in some inexplicable
way been firmly convinced that she was alive
and faithful to him, the plot would have been a
thorough success, and Charles Carriston would have
spent the rest of his days in an asylum.</p>

<p>Both Sir Charles&mdash;he succeeded to his title shortly
after his marriage&mdash;and Lady Carriston are now dead,
or I should not have ventured to relate these things
concerning them. They had twelve years of happiness.
If measured by time the period was but a short one;
but I feel sure that in it they enjoyed more true happiness
than many others find in the course of a protracted
life. In word, thought, and deed they were as
one. She died in Rome of fever, and her husband,
without so far as I know any particular complaint,
simply followed her.</p>

<p>I was always honored with their sincerest friendship,
and Sir Charles left me sole trustee and guardian to
his three sons; so there are now plenty of lives between
Ralph Carriston and his desire. I am pleased
to say that the boys, who are as dear to me as my own
children, as yet show no evidence of possessing any
gifts beyond nature.</p>

<p>I know that my having made this story public will
cause two sets of objectors to fall equally foul of me&mdash;the
matter-of-fact prosaic man who will say that the
abduction and subsequent imprisonment of Madeline
Rowan was an absurd impossibility, and the scientific
man, like myself, who cannot, dare not believe that
Charles Carriston, from neither memory nor imagination,
could draw a face, and describe peculiarities, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
which a certain man could be identified. I am far
from saying there may not be a simple natural explanation
of the puzzle, but I, for one, have failed to
find it, so close this tale as I began it by saying I am a
narrator, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Not one story, but a number of charming
storyettes, terse, snappy and absorbingly
interesting....</p>

<p>There is a delightful pen sketch of a
woman of small means who aspires to a connection
with the smart set. Her attempts
to disguise the true state of affairs from her
out-of-town friends are laughable; but the
fun becomes tinged with pathos when she
borrows a furnished mansion for an evening,
and a rich relative, invited to dine with
her, uncloaks the pitiable fraud....</p>

<p>The promising boy and the fond patroness
are the chief characters in another brilliant
character study in &ldquo;Queer People.&rdquo;...</p>

<div class="blockquo2">
<p>When two women love one man there is
usually trouble brewing. Nor is the story
which Mr. Bishop has to tell an exception.
His hero is a manly New Yorker, who is
fired with a zeal to &ldquo;make good&rdquo; a defalcation
accredited to his dead father....</p>

<p>In quest of gold he visits Mexico and
there meets a dreamy-eyed maid who
straightway gives him first place in her
heart. But an American girl has already
won his love. It is a pathetic situation and
if one true woman&rsquo;s heart breaks before the
man&rsquo;s mission is ended who is to blame?</p>

<p>There are many touching incidents in the
book, but none more full of pathos than
when the woman who loves bares her soul
to the woman who is loved....</p>

<p class="center f24">Among the Freaks</p>

<p class="center">By W. L. ALDEN.</p>
<hr class="l6" />

<div class="blockquo2">
<p>Here is a volume of unique interest,
dealing as it does with the fortunes and
misfortunes of the various &ldquo;freaks&rdquo; to be
found in a Dime Museum. It relates the
woes of the original Wild Man of Borneo,
tells how the Fat Woman tried to elope, of
the marvelous mechanical tail the dwarf
invented, of how the Mermaid boiled her
tail, and of a thrilling plot hatched out by
the Giant and others. Full of telling illustrations.
Easily one of the best works this
gifted writer has ever produced....</p>
